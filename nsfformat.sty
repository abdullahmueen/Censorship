% This is a quick hack to set up a document in NSF's page layout
% format.  I've only handled margins so far -- I assume that a
% reasonable font like times or CMR should obey the font
% requirements.  (Haven't checked this, though.)

% Terran Lane, 2002

% NSF specifies:
%
%Proposals must have 2.5 cm margins at the top, bottom and on each
%side. The type size must be clear and readily legible, and conform to
%the following three requirements: 1) the height of the letters must
%not be smaller than 10 point; 2) type density must be no more than 15
%characters per 2.5 cm; (for proportional spacing, the average for any
%representative section of text must not exceed 15 characters per 2.5
%cm); and, 3) no more than 6 lines must be within a vertical space of
%2.5 cm. The type size used throughout the proposal must conform to all
%three requirements. While line spacing (single-spaced, double-spaced,
%etc.) is at the discretion of the proposer, established page limits
%must be followed. (Individual program solicitations may eliminate this
%proposer option.)
%
%While the guidelines specified above establish the minimum type size
%requirements, PIs are advised that readability is of paramount
%importance and should take precedence in selection of an appropriate
%font for use in the proposal.

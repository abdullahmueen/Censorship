abstract = {We propose an indexing method for time sequences for processing similarity queries. We use the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to map time sequences to the frequency domain, the crucial observation being that, for most sequences of practical interest, only the first few frequencies are strong. Another important observation is Parseval's theorem, which specifies that the Fourier transform preserves the Euclidean distance in the time or frequency domain. Having thus mapped sequences to a lower-dimensionality space by using only the first few Fourier coefficients, we use R * -trees to index the sequences and efficiently answer similarity queries. We provide experimental results which show that our method is superior to search based on sequential scanning. Our experiments show that a few coefficients (1–3) are adequate to provide good performance. The performance gain of our method increases with the number and length of sequences.},

abstract = {A frugal approach to construct speech corpora, specially for re- source deficient languages, is to exploit collections of speech and corresponding text data available in audio books, news, lec- tures. However, using these resources for building speech cor- pora require an alignment of the long duration speech data with the accompanying text data. Existing techniques for automatic speech-text alignment of long audio files assume availability of a basic speech recognition engine and hence cannot be directly used for resource deficient languages. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for sentence level alignment of long speech- text data by exploiting the syllable information in speech and text data. The proposed technique does not depend on the avail- ability of any speech recognition models and hence can be used for resource deficient languages.},

By running numerous experiments in a standardized testbed under highly varying data, queries and operations, we were able to design the R*-tree which incorporates a combined optimization of area, margin and overlap of each enclosing rectangle in the directory. Using our standardized testbed in an exhaustive performance comparison, it turned out that the R*-tree clearly outperforms the existing R-tree variants. Guttman's linear and quadratic R-tree and Greene's variant of the R-tree. This superiority of the R*-tree holds for different types of queries and operations, such as map overlay, for both rectangles and multidimensional points in all experiments. From a practical point of view the R*-tree is very attractive because of the following two reasons 1 it efficiently supports point and spatial data at the same time and 2 its implementation cost is only slightly higher than that of other R-trees.},

abstract = {Online video social networks provides features that allow users to post a video as a response to a discussion topic. These features open opportunities for users to introduce polluted content into the system. For instance, spammers may post an unrelated video as response to a popular one aiming at increasing the likelihood of the response being viewed by a larger number of users. Moreover, opportunistic users - promoters- may try to gain visibility to a specific video by posting a large number of responses to boost the rank of the responded video, making it appear in the top lists maintained by the system. In this paper, we address the issue of detecting video spammers and promoters. Towards that end, we build a test collection of real YouTube users. Using our test collection we investigate the feasibility of using a supervised classification algorithm to detect spammers and promoters. We found that our approach is able to correctly identify the majority of the promoters, misclassifying only a small percentage of legitimate users. In contrast, although we are able to detect a significant fraction of spammers, they showed to be much harder to distinguish from legitimate users.},

abstract = {The problem of distance-based outlier detection is difficult to solve efficiently in very large datasets because of potential quadratic time complexity. We address this problem and develop sequential and distributed algorithms that are significantly more efficient than state-of-the-art methods while still guaranteeing the same outliers. By combining simple but effective indexing and disk block accessing techniques, we have developed a sequential algorithm iOrca that is up to an order-of-magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art. The indexing scheme is based on sorting the data points in order of increasing distance from a fixed reference point and then accessing those points based on this sorted order. To speed up the basic outlier detection technique, we develop two distributed algorithms (DOoR and iDOoR) for modern distributed multi-core clusters of machines, connected on a ring topology. The first algorithm passes data blocks from each machine around the ring, incrementally updating the nearest neighbors of the points passed. By maintaining a cutoff threshold, it is able to prune a large number of points in a distributed fashion. The second distributed algorithm extends this basic idea with the indexing scheme discussed earlier. In our experiments, both distributed algorithms exhibit significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art distributed method [13].},

abstract = {Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) are ubiquitous, and are generated in areas as disparate as sensor recordings in aerospace systems, music and video streams, medical monitoring, and financial systems. Domain experts are often interested in searching for interesting multivariate patterns from these MTS databases which can contain up to several gigabytes of data. Surprisingly, research on MTS search is very limited. Most existing work only supports queries with the same length of data, or queries on a fixed set of variables. In this paper, we propose an efficient and flexible subsequence search framework for massive MTS databases, that, for the first time, enables querying on any subset of variables with arbitrary time delays between them. We propose two provably correct algorithms to solve this problem \#x2014; (1) an R*-tree Based Search (RBS) which uses Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBR) to organize the subsequences, and (2) a List Based Search (LBS) algorithm which uses sorted lists for indexing. We demonstrate the performance of these algorithms using two large MTS databases from the aviation domain, each containing several millions of observations. Both these tests show that our algorithms have very high prune rates (\&\#x003E;95\&\#x025;) thus needing actual disk access for only less than 5\&\#x025; of the observations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first flexible MTS search algorithm capable of subsequence search on any subset of variables. Moreover, MTS subsequence search has never been attempted on datasets of the size we have used in this paper.},

abstract = {A fundamental challenge for current research on speech science and technology is under- standing and modeling individual variation in spoken language. Individuals have their own speaking styles, depending on many factors, such as their dialect and accent as well as their socioeconomic background. These individual differences typically introduce modeling difficulties for large-scale speaker-independent systems designed to process input from any variant of a given language. This dissertation focuses on automatically identifying the di- alect or accent of a speaker given a sample of their speech, and demonstrates how such a technology can be employed to improve Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). In this thesis, we describe a variety of approaches that make use of multiple streams of information in the acoustic signal to build a system that recognizes the regional dialect and accent of a speaker. In particular, we examine frame-based acoustic, phonetic, and phono- tactic features, as well as high-level prosodic features, comparing generative and discrim- inative modeling techniques. We firrst analyze the effectiveness of approaches to language identification that have been successfully employed by that community, applying them here to dialect identification. We next show how we can improve upon these techniques. Finally, we introduce several novel modeling approaches—Discriminative Phonotactics and kernel-based methods. We test our best performing approach on four broad Arabic di- alects, ten Arabic sub-dialects, American English vs. Indian English accents, American English Southern vs. Non-Southern, American dialects at the state level plus Canada, and three Portuguese dialects. Our experiments demonstrate that our novel approach, which relies on the hypothesis that certain phones are realized differently across dialects, achieves new state-of-the-art performance on most dialect recognition tasks. This approach achieves an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 4\% for four broad Arabic dialects, an EER of 6.3\% for American vs. Indian English accents, 14.6\% for American English Southern vs. Non-Southern dialects, and 7.9\% for three Portuguese dialects. Our framework can also be used to automatically extract linguistic knowledge, specifically the context-dependent phonetic cues that may distinguish one dialect form another. We illustrate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating the correlation of our results with geographical proximity of the various dialects. As a final measure of the utility of our studies, we also show that, it is possible to improve ASR. Employing our dialect identification system prior to ASR to identify the Levantine Arabic dialect in mixed speech of a variety of dialects allows us to optimize the engine's language model and use Levantine-specific acoustic models where appropriate. This procedure improves the Word Error Rate (WER) for Levantine by 4.6\% absolute; 9.3\% relative. In addition, we demonstrate in this thesis that, using a linguistically-motivated pronunciation modeling approach, we can improve the WER of a state-of-the art ASR system by 2.2\% absolute and 11.5\% relative WER on Modern Standard Arabic.},

abstract = {We report the design and performance of a brain-computer interface (BCI) system for real-time single-trial binary classification of viewed images based on participant-specific dynamic brain response signatures in high-density (128-channel) electroencephalographic (EEG) data acquired during a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task. Image clips were selected from a broad area image and presented in rapid succession (12/s) in 4.1-s bursts. Participants indicated by subsequent button press whether or not each burst of images included a target airplane feature. Image clip creation and search path selection were designed to maximize user comfort and maintain user awareness of spatial context. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to extract a set of independent source time-courses and their minimally-redundant low-dimensional informative features in the time and time-frequency amplitude domains from 128-channel EEG data recorded during clip burst presentations in a training session. The naive Bayes fusion of two Fisher discriminant classifiers, computed from the 100 most discriminative time and time-frequency features, respectively, was used to estimate the likelihood that each clip contained a target feature. This estimator was applied online in a subsequent test session. Across eight training/test session pairs from seven participants, median area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, by tenfold cross validation, was 0.97 for within-session and 0.87 for between-session estimates, and was nearly as high (0.83) for targets presented in bursts that participants mistakenly reported to include no target features.},

abstract = { The similarity join has become an important database primitive to support similarity search and data mining. A similarity join combines two sets of complex objects such that the result contains all pairs of similar objects. Well-known are two types of the similarity join, the distance range join where the user defines a distance threshold for the join, and the closest point query or k-distance join which retrieves the k most similar pairs. In this paper, we investigate an important, third similarity join operation called k-nearest neighbor join which combines each point Of one point set with its k nearest neighbors in the other set. It has been shown that many standard algorithms of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) such as k-means and k-medoid clustering, nearest neighbor classification, data cleansing, postprocessing of sampling-based data mining etc. can be implemented on top of the k-nn join operation to achieve performance improvements without affecting the quality of the result of these algorithms. We propose a new algorithm to compute the k-nearest neighbor join using the multipage index (MuX), a specialized index structure for the similarity join. To reduce both CPU and I/O cost, we develop optimal loading and processing strategies.},

abstract = {How can we automatically spot all outstanding observations in a data set? This question arises in a large variety of applications, e.g. in economy, biology and medicine. Existing approaches to outlier detection suffer from one or more of the following drawbacks: The results of many methods strongly depend on suitable parameter settings being very difficult to estimate without background knowledge on the data, e.g. the minimum cluster size or the number of desired outliers. Many methods implicitly assume Gaussian or uniformly distributed data, and/or their result is difficult to interpret. To cope with these problems, we propose CoCo, a technique for parameter-free outlier detection. The basic idea of our technique relates outlier detection to data compression: Outliers are objects which can not be effectively compressed given the data set. To avoid the assumption of a certain data distribution, CoCo relies on a very general data model combining the Exponential Power Distribution with Independent Components. We define an intuitive outlier factor based on the principle of the Minimum Description Length together with an novel algorithm for outlier detection. An extensive experimental evaluation on synthetic and real world data demonstrates the benefits of our technique. Availability: The source code of CoCo and the data sets used in the experiments are available at: http://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/Forschung/KDD/Boehm/CoCo.},

abstract = {Salt-sensitive hypertension is known to be associated with dysfunction of the baroreflex control system in the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rat. However, neither the physiological mechanisms nor the genomic regions underlying the baroreflex dysfunction seen in this rat model are definitively known. Here, we have adopted a mathematical modeling approach to investigate the physiological and genetic origins of baroreflex dysfunction in the Dahl SS rat. We have developed a computational model of the overall baroreflex heart rate control system based on known physiological mechanisms to analyze telemetry-based blood pressure and heart rate data from two genetic strains of rat, the SS and consomic SS.13(BN), on low- and high-salt diets. With this approach, physiological parameters are estimated, unmeasured physiological variables related to the baroreflex control system are predicted, and differences in these quantities between the two strains of rat on low- and high-salt diets are detected. Specific findings include: a significant selective impairment in sympathetic gain with high-salt diet in SS rats and a protection from this impairment in SS.13(BN) rats, elevated sympathetic and parasympathetic offsets with high-salt diet in both strains, and an elevated sympathetic tone with high-salt diet in SS but not SS.13(BN) rats. In conclusion, we have associated several important physiological parameters of the baroreflex control system with chromosome 13 and have begun to identify possible physiological mechanisms underlying baroreflex impairment and hypertension in the Dahl SS rat that may be further explored in future experimental and modeling-based investigation.},

abstract = { The problem of statistics and aggregate maintenance over data streams has gained popularity in recent years especially in telecommunications network monitoring, trend-related analysis, Web-click streams, stock tickers, and other time-variant data. The amount of data generated in such applications can become too large to store, or if stored too large to scan multiple times. We consider queries over data streams that are biased towards the more recent values. We develop a technique that summarizes a dynamic stream incrementally at multiple resolutions. This approximation can be used to answer point queries, range queries, and inner product queries. Moreover, the precision of answers can be changed adoptively by a client. Later, we extend the above technique to work in a distributed setting, specifically in a large network where a central site summarizes the stream and clients ask queries. We minimize the message overhead by deciding what and where to replicate by using an adaptive replication scheme. We maintain a hierarchy of approximations that change adoptively based on the query and update rates. We show experimentally that our technique performs better than existing techniques: up to 50 times better in terms of approximation quality, up to four orders of magnitude times better in response time, and up to five times better in terms of message complexity.},

abstract = {Investigations into action monitoring have consistently detailed a frontocentral voltage deflection in the event-related potential (ERP) following the presentation of negatively valenced feedback, sometimes termed the feedback-related negativity (FRN). The FRN has been proposed to reflect a neural response to prediction errors during reinforcement learning, yet the single-trial relationship between neural activity and the quanta of expectation violation remains untested. Although ERP methods are not well suited to single-trial analyses, the FRN has been associated with theta band oscillatory perturbations in the medial prefrontal cortex. Mediofrontal theta oscillations have been previously associated with expectation violation and behavioral adaptation and are well suited to single-trial analysis. Here, we recorded EEG activity during a probabilistic reinforcement learning task and fit the performance data to an abstract computational model (Q-learning) for calculation of single-trial reward prediction errors. Single-trial theta oscillatory activities following feedback were investigated within the context of expectation (prediction error) and adaptation (subsequent reaction time change). Results indicate that interactive medial and lateral frontal theta activities reflect the degree of negative and positive reward prediction error in the service of behavioral adaptation. These different brain areas use prediction error calculations for different behavioral adaptations, with medial frontal theta reflecting the utilization of prediction errors for reaction time slowing (specifically following errors), but lateral frontal theta reflecting prediction errors leading to working memory-related reaction time speeding for the correct choice. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Error-related activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is thought to work in conjunction with lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) as a part of an action-monitoring network, where errors signal the need for increased cognitive control. The neural mechanism by which this mPFC-lPFC interaction occurs remains unknown. We hypothesized that transient synchronous oscillations in the theta range reflect a mechanism by which these structures interact. To test this hypothesis, we extracted oscillatory phase and power from current-source-density-transformed electroencephalographic data recorded during a Flanker task. Theta power in the mPFC was diminished on the trial preceding an error and increased immediately after an error, consistent with predictions of an action-monitoring system. These power dynamics appeared to take place over a response-related background of oscillatory theta phase coherence. Theta phase synchronization between FCz (mPFC) and F5/6 (lPFC) sites was robustly increased during error trials. The degree of mPFC-lPFC oscillatory synchronization predicted the degree of mPFC power on error trials, and both of these dynamics predicted the degree of posterror reaction time slowing. Oscillatory dynamics in the theta band may in part underlie a mechanism of communication between networks involved in action monitoring and cognitive control.},

abstract = {Pavlovian biases influence learning and decision making by intricately coupling reward seeking with action invigoration and punishment avoidance with action suppression. This bias is not always adaptive-it can often interfere with instrumental requirements. The prefrontal cortex is thought to help resolve such conflict between motivational systems, but the nature of this control process remains unknown. EEG recordings of midfrontal theta band power are sensitive to conflict and predictive of adaptive control over behavior, but it is not clear whether this signal reflects control over conflict between motivational systems. Here we used a task that orthogonalized action requirements and outcome valence while recording concurrent EEG in human participants. By applying a computational model of task performance, we derived parameters reflective of the latent influence of Pavlovian bias and how it was modulated by midfrontal theta power during motivational conflict. Between subjects, those who performed better under Pavlovian conflict exhibited higher midfrontal theta power. Within subjects, trial-to-trial variance in theta power was predictive of ability to overcome the influence of the Pavlovian bias, and this effect was most pronounced in subjects with higher midfrontal theta to conflict. These findings demonstrate that midfrontal theta is not only a sensitive index of prefrontal control, but it can also reflect the application of top-down control over instrumental processes.},

Experiments done in previous work showed that a simple hierarchy of Support Vectors Machines (SVM) with a top-down evaluation scheme has a surprisingly good performance on this kind of task. In this paper, we introduce a refined evaluation scheme which turns the hierarchical SVM classifier into an approximator of the Bayes optimal classifier with respect to a simple stochastic model for the labels. Experiments on synthetic datasets, generated according to this stochastic model, show that our refined algorithm outperforms the simple hierarchical SVM. On real-world data, however, the advantage brought by our approach is a bit less clear. We conjecture this is due to a higher noise rate for the training labels
in the low levels of the taxonomy.},

abstract = {Similarity search in large time series databases has attracted much research interest recently. It is a difficult problem because of the typically high dimensionality of the data.. The most promising solutions involve performing dimensionality reduction on the data, then indexing the reduced data with a multidimensional index structure. Many dimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed, including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). In this work we introduce a new dimensionality reduction technique which we call Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation (APCA). While previous techniques (e.g., SVD, DFT and DWT) choose a common representation for all the items in the database that minimizes the global reconstruction error, APCA approximates each time series by a set of constant value segments of varying lengths such that their individual reconstruction errors are minimal. We show how APCA can be indexed using a multidimensional index structure. We propose two distance measures in the indexed space that exploit the high fidelity of APCA for fast searching: a lower bounding Euclidean distance approximation, and a non-lower bounding, but very tight Euclidean distance approximation and show how they can support fast exact searching, and even faster approximate searching on the same index structure. We theoretically and empirically compare APCA to all the other techniques and demonstrate its superiority. Categories},

abstract = {This thesis deals with the problem of anomaly detection for sequence data. Anomaly detection has been a widely researched problem in several application domains such as system health management, intrusion detection, healthcare, bioinformatics, fraud detection, and mechanical fault detection. Traditional anomaly detection techniques analyze each data instance (as a univariate or multivariate record) independently, and ignore the sequential aspect of the data. Often, anomalies in sequences can be detected only by analyzing data instances together as a sequence, and hence cannot detected by traditional anomaly detection techniques. The problem of anomaly detection for sequence data is a rich area of research because of two main reasons. First, sequences can be of different types, e.g., symbolic sequences, time series data, etc., and each type of sequence poses unique set of problems. Second, anomalies in sequences can be defined in multiple ways and hence there are different problem formulations. In this thesis we focus on solving one particular problem formulation called semi-supervised anomaly detection. We study the problem separately for symbolic sequences, univariate time series data, and multivariate time series data. The state of art on anomaly detection for sequences is limited and fragmented across application domains. For symbolic sequences, several techniques have been proposed within specific domains, but it is not well-understood as to how a technique developed for one domain would perform in a completely different domain. For univariate time series data, limited techniques exist, and are only evaluated for specific domains, while for multivariate time series data, anomaly detection research is relatively untouched. This thesis has two key goals. First goal is to develop novel anomaly detection techniques for different types of sequences which perform better than existing techniques across a variety of application domains. The second goal is to identify the best anomaly detection technique for a given application domain. By realizing the first goal we develop a suite of anomaly detection techniques for a domain scientist to choose from, while the second goal will help the scientist to choose the technique best suited for the task. To achieve the first goal we develop several novel anomaly detection techniques for univariate symbolic sequences, univariate time series data, and multivariate time series data. We provide extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed techniques on data sets collected across diverse domains and generated from data generators, also developed as part of this thesis. We show how the proposed techniques can be used to detect anomalies which translate to critical events in domains such as aircraft safety, intrusion detection, and patient health management. The techniques proposed in this thesis are shown to outperform existing techniques on many data sets. The technique proposed for multivariate time series data is one of the very first anomaly detection technique that can detect complex anomalies in such data. To achieve the second goal, we study the relationship between anomaly detection techniques and the nature of the data on which they are applied. A novel analysis framework, Reference Based Analysis (RBA), is proposed that can map a given data set (of any type) into a multivariate continuous space with respect to a reference data set. We apply the RBA framework to not only visualize and understand complex data types, such as multivariate categorical data and symbolic sequence data, but also to extract data driven features from symbolic sequences, which when used with traditional anomaly detection techniques are shown to consistently outperform the state of art anomaly detection techniques for these complex data types. Two novel techniques for symbolic sequences, WIN1D and WIN2D are proposed using the RBA framework which perform better than the best technique for each different data set.},

abstract = {We introduce a new probabilistic proximity search algorithm for range and K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) searching in both coordinate and metric spaces. Although there exist solutions for these problems, they boil down to a linear scan when the space is intrinsically high-dimensional, as is the case in many pattern recognition tasks. This, for example, renders the K-NN approach to classification rather slow in large databases. Our novel idea is to predict closeness between elements according to how they order their distances towards a distinguished set of anchor objects. Each element in the space sorts the anchor objects from closest to farthest to it, and the similarity between orders turns out to be an excellent predictor of the closeness between the corresponding elements. We present extensive experiments comparing our method against state-of-the-art exact and approximate techniques, both in synthetic and real, metric and non-metric databases, measuring both CPU time and distance computations. The experiments demonstrate that our technique almost always improves upon the performance of alternative techniques, in some cases by a wide margin.},

abstract = {The speech prosody of a group of patients in the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) was compared to that of a group of healthy age- and education-matched controls to quantify possible acoustic changes in speech production secondary to PD. Both groups produced standardized speech samples across a number of prosody conditions: phonemic stress, contrastive stress, and emotional prosody. The amplitude, fundamental frequency, and duration of all tokens were measured. PD speakers produced speech that was of lower amplitude than the tokens of healthy speakers in many conditions across all production tasks. Fundamental frequency distinguished the two speaker groups for contrastive stress and emotional prosody production, and duration differentiated the groups for phonemic stress production. It was concluded that motor impairments in PD lead to adverse and varied acoustic changes which affect a number of prosodic contrasts in speech and that these alterations appear to occur in earlier stages of disease progression than is often presumed by many investigators. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Discovering non-trivial matching subsequences from two time series is very useful in synthesizing novel time series. This can be applied to applications such as motion synthesis where smooth and natural motion sequences are often required to be generated from existing motion sequences. We first address this problem by defining it as a problem of l-epsiv-join over two time series. Given two time series, the goal of l-epsiv-join is to find those non-trivial matching subsequences by detecting maximal l-connections from the epsiv-matching matrix of the two time series. Given a querying motion sequence, the l-epsiv-join can be applied to retrieve all connectable motion sequences from a database of motion sequences. To support efficient l-epsiv-join of time series, we propose a two-step filter-and-refine algorithm, called warping time series join (WTSJ) algorithm. The filtering step serves to prune those sparse regions of the epsiv-matching matrix where there are no maximal l-connections without incurring costly computation. The refinement step serves to detect closed l-connections within regions that cannot be pruned by the filtering step. To speed up the computation of epsiv-matching matrix, we propose a block-based time series summarization method, based on which the block-wise epsiv-matching matrix is first computed. Lots of pairwise distance computation of elements can then be avoided by applying the filtering algorithm on the block-wise epsiv-matching matrix. Extensive experiments on l-epsiv-join of motion capture sequences are conducted. The results confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in processing l-epsiv-join of motion capture time series.},

abstract = {Twitter is a new web application playing dual roles of online social networking and microblogging. Users communicate with each other by publishing text-based posts. The popularity and open structure of Twitter have attracted a large number of automated programs, known as bots, which appear to be a double-edged sword to Twitter. Legitimate bots generate a large amount of benign tweets delivering news and updating feeds, while malicious bots spread spam or malicious contents. More interestingly, in the middle between human and bot, there has emerged cyborg referred to either bot-assisted human or human-assisted bot. To assist human users in identifying who they are interacting with, this paper focuses on the classification of human, bot, and cyborg accounts on Twitter. We first conduct a set of large-scale measurements with a collection of over 500,000 accounts. We observe the difference among human, bot, and cyborg in terms of tweeting behavior, tweet content, and account properties. Based on the measurement results, we propose a classification system that includes the following four parts: 1) an entropy-based component, 2) a spam detection component, 3) an account properties component, and 4) a decision maker. It uses the combination of features extracted from an unknown user to determine the likelihood of being a human, bot, or cyborg. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed classification system.},

abstract = {Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) process brain activity in real time, and mediate non-muscular interaction between and individual and the environment. The subserving algorithms can be used to provide a quantitative measurement of physiological or pathological cognitive processes - such as Motor Imagery (MI) - and feed it back the user. In this paper we propose the clinical application of a BCI-based rehabilitation device, to promote motor recovery after stroke. The BCI-based device and the therapy exploiting its use follow the same principles that drive classical neuromotor rehabilitation, and (i) provides the physical therapist with a monitoring instrument, to assess the patient's participation in the rehabilitative cognitive exercise; (ii) assists the patient in the practice of MI. The device was installed in the ward of a rehabilitation hospital and a group of 29 patients were involved in its testing. Among them, eight have already undergone a one-month training with the device, as an add-on to the regular therapy. An improved system, which includes analysis of Electromyographic (EMG) patterns and Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) of the arm muscles, is also under clinical evaluation. We found that the rehabilitation exercise based on BCI-mediated neurofeedback mechanisms enables a better engagement of motor areas with respect to motor imagery alone and thus it can promote neuroplasticity in brain regions affected by a cerebrovascular accident. Preliminary results also suggest that the functional outcome of motor rehabilitation may be improved by the use of the proposed device.},

abstract = {Data arriving in time order (a data stream) arises in fields including physics, finance, medicine, and music, to name a few. Often the data comes from sensors (in physics and medicine for example) whose data rates continue to improve dramatically as sensor technology improves. Further, the number of sensors is increasing, so correlating data between sensors becomes ever more critical in order to distill knowl- ege from the data. In many applications such as finance, recent correlations are of far more interest than long-term correlation, so correlation over sliding windows (windowed correlation) is the desired operation. Fast response is de- sirable in many applications (e.g., to aim a telescope at an activity of interest or to perform a stock trade). These three factors – data size, windowed correlation, and fast response – motivate this work. Previous work [10, 14] showed how to compute Pearson correlation using Fast Fourier Transforms andWavelet trans- forms, but such techniques don’t work for time series in which the energy is spread over many frequency compo- nents, thus resembling white noise. For such “uncoopera- tive” time series, this paper shows how to combine several simple techniques – sketches (random projections), convolu- tion, structured random vectors, grid structures, and com- binatorial design – to achieve high performance windowed Pearson correlation over a variety of data sets},

abstract = { The nearest neighbor decision rule assigns to an unclassified sample point the classification of the nearest of a set of previously classified points. This rule is independent of the underlying joint distribution on the sample points and their classifications, and hence the probability of error<tex>R</tex>of such a rule must be at least as great as the Bayes probability of error<tex>R\^{}\{ast\}</tex>--the minimum probability of error over all decision rules taking underlying probability structure into account. However, in a large sample analysis, we will show in the<tex>M</tex>-category case that<tex>R\^{}\{ast\} leq R leq R\^{}\{ast\}(2 --MR\^{}\{ast\}/(M-1))</tex>, where these bounds are the tightest possible, for all suitably smooth underlying distributions. Thus for any number of categories, the probability of error of the nearest neighbor rule is bounded above by twice the Bayes probability of error. In this sense, it may be said that half the classification information in an infinite sample set is contained in the nearest neighbor.},

abstract = {This paper describes a probabilistic approach to the problem of recognizing places based on their appearance. The system we present is not limited to localization, but can determine that a new observation comes from a previously unseen place, and so augment its map. Effectively this is a SLAM system in the space of appearance. Our probabilistic approach allows us to explicitly account for perceptual aliasing in the environment--identical but indistinctive observations receive a low probability of having come from the same place. We achieve this by learning a generative model of place appearance. By partitioning the learning problem into two parts, new place models can be learned online from only a single observation of a place. The algorithm complexity is linear in the number of places in the map, and is particularly suitable for online loop closure detection in mobile robotics.},

In our model, we deal with resource constraints by shedding load in the form of dropping tuples from the data streams. We first discuss alternate architectural models for data stream join processing, and we survey suitable measures for the quality of an approximation of a set-valued query result. We then consider the number of generated result tuples as the quality measure, and we give optimal offline and fast online algorithms for it. In a thorough experimental study with synthetic and real data we show the efficacy of our solutions. For applications with demand for exact results we introduce a new Archive-metric which captures the amount of work needed to complete the join in case the streams are archived for later processing.},

abstract = {P>1. Many animal species are detected primarily by sound. Although songs, calls and other sounds are often used for population assessment, as in bird point counts and hydrophone surveys of cetaceans, there are few rigorous methods for estimating population density from acoustic data. 2. The problem has several parts - distinguishing individuals, adjusting for individuals that are missed, and adjusting for the area sampled. Spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) is a statistical methodology that addresses jointly the second and third parts of the problem. We have extended SECR to use uncalibrated information from acoustic signals on the distance to each source. 3. We applied this extension of SECR to data from an acoustic survey of ovenbird Seiurus aurocapilla density in an eastern US deciduous forest with multiple four-microphone arrays. We modelled average power from spectrograms of ovenbird songs measured within a window of 0 center dot 7 s duration and frequencies between 4200 and 5200 Hz. 4. The resulting estimates of the density of singing males (0 center dot 19 ha-1 SE 0 center dot 03 ha-1) were consistent with estimates of the adult male population density from mist-netting (0 center dot 36 ha-1 SE 0 center dot 12 ha-1). The fitted model predicts sound attenuation of 0 center dot 11 dB m-1 (SE 0 center dot 01 dB m-1) in excess of losses from spherical spreading. 5.Synthesis and applications. Our method for estimating animal population density from acoustic signals fills a gap in the census methods available for visually cryptic but vocal taxa, including many species of bird and cetacean. The necessary equipment is simple and readily available; as few as two microphones may provide adequate estimates, given spatial replication. The method requires that individuals detected at the same place are acoustically distinguishable and all individuals vocalize during the recording interval, or that the per capita rate of vocalization is known. We believe these requirements can be met, with suitable field methods, for a significant number of songbird species.},

In this paper we present the novel idea of modeling the document collection as a bipartite graph between documents and words, using which the simultaneous clustering problem can be posed as a bipartite graph partitioning problem. To solve the partitioning problem, we use a new spectral co-clustering algorithm that uses the second left and right singular vectors of an appropriately scaled word-document matrix to yield good bipartitionings. The spectral algorithm enjoys some optimality properties; it can be shown that the singular vectors solve a real relaxation to the NP-complete graph bipartitioning problem. We present experimental results to verify that the resulting co-clustering algorithm works well in practice.},

The individual predictors (weak learners) can be very simple, such as two terminal-node trees; it is the aggregating scheme that gives them the power of increasing prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, many combining methods do not improve nearest neighbor (NN) classifiers at all. This is because NN methods are very robust with respect to variations of a data set. In contrast, they are sensitive to input features. We exploit the instability of NN classifiers with respect to different choices of features to generate an effective and diverse set of NN classifiers with possibly uncorrelated errors. Interestingly, the approach takes advantage of the high dimensionality of the data. The experimental results show that our technique offers significant performance improvements with respect to competitive methods.},

abstract = {Objective: For the last years, time-series mining has become a challenging issue for researchers. An important application lies in most monitoring purposes, which require analyzing large sets of time-series for learning usual patterns. Any deviation from this learned profile is then considered as an unexpected situation. Moreover, complex applications may involve the temporal study of several heterogeneous parameters. In that paper, we propose a method for mining heterogeneous multivariate time-series for learning meaningful patterns. Methods: The proposed approach allows for mixed time-series - containing both pattern and non-pattern data - such as for imprecise matches, outliers, stretching and global translating of patterns instances in time. Results: We present the results of our approach on synthetic data generated in the context of monitoring a person at home, as well as early results on few real sequences. The purpose is to build a behavioral profile of a person in their daily activities by analyzing the time variations of several quantitative or qualitative parameters recorded through a provision of sensors. Conclusions: The results are very promising. They also highlight the difficulty of tuning the parameters of the method. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = { Periodicity mining is used for predicting trends in time series data. Discovering the rate at which the time series is periodic has always been an obstacle for fully automated periodicity mining. Existing periodicity mining algorithms assume that the periodicity, rate (or simply the period) is user-specified. This assumption is a considerable limitation, especially in time series data where the period is not known a priori. In this paper, we address the problem of detecting the periodicity rate of a time series database. Two types of periodicities are defined, and a scalable, computationally efficient algorithm is proposed for each type. The algorithms perform in O(n log n) time for a time series of length n. Moreover, the proposed algorithms are extended in order to discover the periodic patterns of unknown periods at the same time without affecting the time complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms are highly accurate with respect to the discovered periodicity rates and periodic patterns. Real-data experiments demonstrate the practicality of the discovered periodic patterns.},

Based on a technique previously used by the author for Euclidean closest pairs, we show how to insert and delete objects from an n-object set, maintaining the closest pair, in O(n log\^{}2 n) time per update and O(n) space. With quadratic space, we can instead use a quadtree-like structure to achieve an optimal time bound, O(n) per update. We apply these data structures to hierarchical clustering, greedy matching, and TSP heuristics, and discuss other potential applications in machine learning, Groebner bases, and local improvement algorithms for partition and placement problems.

abstract = {We study graph partitioning problems on graphs with edge capacities and vertex weights. The problems of b-balanced cuts and k-balanced partitions are unified into a new problem called minimum capacity $\rho$-separators. A $\rho$-separator is a subset of edges whose removal parti- tions the vertex set into connected components such that the sum of the vertex weights in each component is at most $\rho$ times the weight of the graph. We present a new and simple O(logn)- approximation algorithm for minimum capacity $\rho$-separators which is based on spreading metrics yielding an O(logn)-approximation algorithm both for b-balanced cuts and k-balanced partitions. In particular, this result improves the previous best known approximation factor for k-balanced partitions in undirected graphs by a factor of O(logk). We enhance these results by presenting a version of the algorithm that obtains an O(log opt)-approximation factor. The algorithm is based on a technique called spreading metrics that enables us to formulate directly the minimum capacity $\rho$-separator problem as an integer program. We also introduce a generalization called the simultane- ous separator problem, where the goal is to find a minimum capacity subset of edges that separates a given collection of subsets simultaneously. We extend our results to directed graphs for values of $\rho$ ≥ 1/2. We conclude with an efficient algorithm for computing an optimal spreading metric for $\rho$- separators. This yields more efficient algorithms for computing b-balanced cuts than were previously known.},

abstract = {We present recent developments in the openSMILE feature extraction toolkit. Version 2.0 now unites feature extraction paradigms from speech, music, and general sound events with basic video features for multi-modal processing. Descriptors from audio and video can be processed jointly in a single framework allowing for time synchronization of parameters, on-line incremental processing as well as off-line and batch processing, and the extraction of statistical functionals (feature summaries), such as moments, peaks, regression parameters, etc. Postprocessing of the features includes statistical classifiers such as support vector machine models or file export for popular toolkits such as Weka or HTK. Available low-level descriptors include popular speech, music and video features including Mel-frequency and similar cepstral and spectral coefficients, Chroma, CENS, auditory model based loudness, voice quality, local binary pattern, color, and optical flow histograms. Besides, voice activity detection, pitch tracking and face detection are supported. openSMILE is implemented in C++, using standard open source libraries for on-line audio and video input. It is fast, runs on Unix and Windows platforms, and has a modular, component based architecture which makes extensions via plug-ins easy. openSMILE 2.0 is distributed under a research license and can be downloaded from http://opensmile.sourceforge.net/.},

A motif is a subseries pattern that appears a significant number of times. Results demonstrate that motifs may provide valuable insights about the data and have a wide range of applications in data mining tasks. The main motivation for this study was the need to mine time series data from protein folding/unfolding simulations.We propose an algorithm that ex- tracts approximate motifs, i.e. motifs that capture portions of time series with a similar and eventually symmetric behavior. Preliminary results on the analysis of protein unfolding data support this proposal as a valuable tool. Additional experiments demonstrate that the application of utility of our algorithm is not limited to this particular problem. Rather it can be an interesting tool to be applied in many real world problems.},

In practice, only a very small number of passes are typically needed, leading to a fast approximation algorithm for mincut partitioning. To deal with cells of various sizes, the algorithm progresses by moving one cell at a time between the blocks of the partition while maintaining a desired balance based on the size of the blocks rather than the number of cells per block. Efficient data structures are used to avoid unnecessary searching for the best cell to move and to minimize unnecessary updating of cells affected by each move.},

abstract = {This article presents SwiftMotif, a novel technique for on-line motif detection in time series. With this technique, frequently occurring temporal patterns or anomalies can be discovered, for instance. The motif detection is based on a fusion of methods from two worlds: probabilistic modeling and similarity measurement techniques are combined with extremely fast polynomial least-squares approximation techniques. A time series is segmented with a data stream segmentation method, the segments are modeled by means of normal distributions with time-dependent means and constant variances, and these models are compared using a divergence measure for probability densities. Then, using suitable clustering algorithms based on these similarity measures, motifs may be defined. The fast time series segmentation and modeling techniques then allow for an on-line detection of previously defined motifs in new time series with very low run-times. SwiftMotif is suitable for real-time applications, accounts for the uncertainty associated with the occurrence of certain motifs, e.g., due to noise, and considers local variability (i.e., uniform scaling) in the time domain. This article focuses on the mathematical foundations and the demonstration of properties of SwiftMotif-in particular accuracy and run-time-using some artificial and real benchmark time series. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In many applications from telephone fraud detection to network management, data arrives in a stream, and there is a need to maintain a variety of statistical summary information about a large number of customers in an online fashion. At present, such applications maintain basic aggregates such as running extrema values (MIN, MAX), averages, standard deviations, etc., that can be computed over data streams with limited space in a straightforward way. However, many applications require knowledge of more complex aggregates relating different attributes, so-called correlated aggregates. As an example, one might be interested in computing the percentage of international phone calls that are longer than the average duration of a domestic phone call. Exact computation of this aggregate requires multiple passes over the data stream, which is infeasible. We propose single-pass techniques for approximate computation of correlated aggregates over both landmark and sliding window views of a data stream of tuples, using a very limited amount of space. We consider both the case where the independent aggregate (average duration in the example above) is an extrema value and the case where it is an average value, with any standard aggregate as the dependent aggregate; these can be used as building blocks for more sophisticated aggregates. We present an extensive experimental study based on some real and a wide variety of synthetic data sets to demonstrate the accuracy of our techniques. We show that this effectiveness is explained by the fact that our techniques exploit monotonicity and convergence properties of aggregates over data streams.},

abstract = {The newly inaugurated Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals, which was created under the auspices of the National Center for Research Resources of the National Institutes of Health, is intended to stimulate current research and new investigations in the study of cardiovascular and other complex biomedical signals. The resource has 3 interdependent components. PhysioBank is a large and growing archive of well-characterized digital recordings of physiological signals and related data for use by the biomedical research community. It currently includes databases of multiparameter cardiopulmonary, neural, and other biomedical signals from healthy subjects and from patients with a variety of conditions with major public health implications, including life-threatening arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, neurological disorders, and aging. PhysioToolkit is a library of open-source software for physiological signal processing and analysis, the detection of physiologically significant events using both classic techniques and novel methods based on statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics, the interactive display and characterization of signals, the creation of new databases, the simulation of physiological and other signals, the quantitative evaluation and comparison of analysis methods, and the analysis of nonstationary processes. PhysioNet is an on-line forum for the dissemination and exchange of recorded biomedical signals and open-source software for analyzing them. It provides facilities for the cooperative analysis of data and the evaluation of proposed new algorithms. In addition to providing free electronic access to PhysioBank data and PhysioToolkit software via the World Wide Web (http://www.physionet. org), PhysioNet offers services and training via on-line tutorials to assist users with varying levels of expertise.},

abstract = {Data analysis applications typically aggregate data across many
dimensions looking for unusual patterns. The SQL aggregate functions and
the GROUP BY operator produce zero-dimensional or one-dimensional
answers. Applications need the N-dimensional generalization of these
operators. The paper defines that operator, called the data cube or
simply cube. The cube operator generalizes the histogram,
cross-tabulation, roll-up, drill-down, and sub-total constructs found in
most report writers. The cube treats each of the N aggregation
attributes as a dimension of N-space. The aggregate of a particular set
of attribute values is a point in this space. The set of points forms an
N-dimensionaI cube. Super-aggregates are computed by aggregating the
N-cube to lower dimensional spaces. Aggregation points are represented
by an \&amp;ldquo;infinite value\&amp;rdquo;: ALL, so the point (ALL,ALL,...,ALL,
sum(*)) represents the global sum of all items. Each ALL value actually
represents the set of values contributing to that aggregation},

abstract = {In this work we present a characterization of spam on Twitter. We find that 8\% of 25 million URLs posted to the site point to phishing, malware, and scams listed on popular blacklists. We analyze the accounts that send spam and find evidence that it originates from previously legitimate accounts that have been compromised and are now being puppeteered by spammers. Using clickthrough data, we analyze spammers’ use of features unique to Twitter and the degree that they affect the success of spam. We find that Twitter is a highly successful platform for coercing users to visit spam pages, with a clickthrough rate of 0.13\%, compared to much lower rates previously reported for email spam. We group spam URLs into campaigns and identify trends that uniquely distinguish phishing, malware, and spam, to gain an insight into the underlying techniques used to attract users. Given the absence of spam filtering on Twitter, we examine whether the use of URL blacklists would help to significantly stem the spread of Twitter spam. Our results indicate that blacklists are too slow at identifying new threats, allowing more than 90\% of visitors to view a page before it becomes blacklisted. We also find that even if blacklist delays were reduced, the use by spammers of URL shortening services for obfuscation negates the potential gains unless tools that use blacklists develop more sophisticated spam filtering.},

This task is known to be difficult: the temporal and multivariate nature of the data at hand and the context-sensitive aspect of data interpretation hamper the formulation of a priori knowledge about the kind of patterns that can be detected as well as their interrelations. This paper proposes a new way to tackle this problem based on a human\^{a}€“computer collaborative approach involving specific annotations. Three grounding principles, namely autonomy, adaptability and emergence, support the co-construction of successive abstraction levels for data interpretation. An agent-based design is proposed to support these principles. Preliminary results in a clinical context are presented to support our proposal. A comparison with two well-known time series exploration tools is furthermore performed.},

abstract = {Partial periodicity search, i.e., search for partial periodic
patterns in time-series databases, is an interesting data mining
problem. Previous studies on periodicity search mainly consider finding
full periodic patterns, where every point in time contributes (precisely
or approximately) to the periodicity. However, partial periodicity is
very common in practice since it is more likely that only some of the
time episodes may exhibit periodic patterns. We present several
algorithms for efficient mining of partial periodic patterns, by
exploring some interesting properties related to partial periodicity
such as the Apriori property and the max-subpattern hit set property,
and by shared mining of multiple periods. The max-subpattern hit set
property is a vital new property which allows us to derive the counts of
all frequent patterns from a relatively small subset of patterns
existing in the time series. We show that mining partial periodicity
needs only two scans over the time series database, even for mining
multiple periods. The performance study shows our proposed methods are
very efficient in mining long periodic patterns},

abstract = {Existing work on similar sequence matching has focused on either whole matching or range subsequence matching. In this paper, we present novel methods for ranked subsequence matching under time warping, which finds top-k subsequences most similar to a query sequence from data sequences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and most sophisticated subsequence matching solution mentioned in the literature. Specifically, we first provide a new notion of the minimum-distance matching-window pair (MDMWP) and formally define the mdmwp-distance, a lower bound between a data subsequence and a query sequence. The mdmwp-distance can be computed prior to accessing the actual subsequence. Based on the mdmwp-distance, we then develop a ranked subsequence matching algorithm to prune unnecessary subsequence accesses. Next, to reduce random disk I/Os and bad buffer utilization, we develop a method of deferred group subsequence retrieval. We then derive another lower bound, the window-group distance, that can be used to effectively prune unnecessary subsequence accesses during deferred group-subsequence retrieval. Through extensive experiments with many data sets, we showcase the superiority of the proposed methods.},

However, the complementary problem of negative deceptive opinion spam, intended to slander competitive offerings, remains largely unstudied. Follow- ing an approach similar to Ott et al.

Based on this dataset, we find that standard n-gram text categorization tech- niques can detect negative deceptive opinion spam with performance far surpassing that of human judges. Finally, in conjunction with the aforementioned positive review dataset, we consider the possible interactions between sentiment and deception, and present initial results that encourage further exploration of this relationship. 1},

Especially for roughly segmented time series with spatial distortions, such as human gestures, it is complicated to find templates, which optimally represent signal classes. In this paper we present an approach to find optimal time series prototypes in subseries of class templates. Our optimization approach is based on separability measures for prototype candidates and utilizes (but is not limited to) DTW in order to tackle the problem of spatial and temporal distortions. The search for prototypes in the target space is performed by means of a brute force search as well as an evolution strategy. In our experiments with an artificial dataset we show that brute force search optimization is able to improve the time series classification result and that the application of an evolution strategy yields comparable target function scores while reducing computing time. © 2010, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.},

Our DTW implementation is able to deal with gesture signals varying in amplitude and to resolve ambiguities in the recognition result when DTW is used for multiclass classification. In order to find representative prototypes, an optimization method is proposed basing on an evolution strategy. By means of this prototype optimization method, we search for prototypes that yield a good class separation. Furthermore, the optimization is able to cope with approximately labelled training data, since optimal prototypes can be found in subseries of class templates. The approach has been tested with a dataset of hand gesture sequences, which have been recorded with accelerometers. Our evaluation shows that our method achieves high precision rates and good recall rates in user-dependent online gesture recognition.},

A distinct pattern of response was found for each stimulus category. The distinctiveness of the response to a given category was not due simply to the regions that responded maximally to that category, because the category being viewed also could be identified on the basis of the pattern of response when those regions were excluded from the analysis. Patterns of response that discriminated among all categories were found even within cortical regions that responded maximally to only one category.

Ptolemy's inequality holds for the well-known Euclidean distance, but is also shown here to hold for quadratic form metrics in general. In addition, the square root of any metric is Ptolemaic, which means that the principles introduced in this paper have a very wide applicability. The inequality is examined empirically on both synthetic and real-world data sets and is also found to hold approximately, with a very low degree of error, for important distances such as the angular pseudometric and several Lp norms. Indexing experiments are performed on several data sets, demonstrating a highly increased filtering power when using certain forms of Ptolemaic filtering, compared to existing, triangular methods. It is also shown that combining the Ptolemaic and triangular filtering can lead to better results than using either approach on its own.},

abstract = {Paralysis following spinal cord injury, brainstem stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other disorders can disconnect the brain from the body, eliminating the ability to perform volitional movements. A neural interface system could restore mobility and independence for people with paralysis by translating neuronal activity directly into control signals for assistive devices. We have previously shown that people with long-standing tetraplegia can use a neural interface system to move and click a computer cursor and to control physical devices. Able-bodied monkeys have used a neural interface system to control a robotic arm, but it is unknown whether people with profound upper extremity paralysis or limb loss could use cortical neuronal ensemble signals to direct useful arm actions. Here we demonstrate the ability of two people with long-standing tetraplegia to use neural interface system-based control of a robotic arm to perform three-dimensional reach and grasp movements. Participants controlled the arm and hand over a broad space without explicit training, using signals decoded from a small, local population of motor cortex (MI) neurons recorded from a 96-channel microelectrode array. One of the study participants, implanted with the sensor 5 years earlier, also used a robotic arm to drink coffee from a bottle. Although robotic reach and grasp actions were not as fast or accurate as those of an able-bodied person, our results demonstrate the feasibility for people with tetraplegia, years after injury to the central nervous system, to recreate useful multidimensional control of complex devices directly from a small sample of neural signals.},

abstract = {Computer-aided interpretation of electrocardiograms (ECGs) is widespread but many physicians hesitate to rely on the computer, because the advice is presented without information about the confidence of the advice. The purpose of this work was to develop a method to validate the advice of a computer by estimating the error of an artificial neural network output. A total of 1249 ECGs, recorded with computerized electrocardiographs, on patients who had undergone diagnostic cardiac catheterization were studied. The material consisted of two groups, 414 patients with and 835 without anterior myocardial infarction. The material was randomly divided into three data sets. The first set was used to train an artificial neural network for the diagnosis of anterior infarction. The second data set was used to calculate the error of the network outputs. The last data set was used to test the network performance and to estimate the error of the network outputs. The performance of the neural network, measured as the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, was 0.887 (0.845-0.922). The 25\% test ECGs with the lowest error estimates had an area under the ROC curve as high as 0.995 (0.982-1.000), i.e. almost all of these ECGs were correctly classified. Neural networks can therefore be trained to diagnose myocardial infarction and to signal when the advice is given with great confidence or when it should be considered more carefully. This method increases the possibility that artificial neural networks will be accepted as reliable decision support systems in clinical practice.},

abstract = {With rapid advances in hardware speed and data communication bandwidth, one might not expect to have to deal with issues such as response time and system performance. But these issues remain a very real concern today. Lengthy system response times may cause lower satisfaction and poor productivity among users. Lowered user satisfaction may lead to discontinued use of an application, especially in discretionary applications such as those found on the Internet. The intent of this experimental research is to (1) substantiate that slow system response time leads to dissatisfaction; (2) assess the point at which users may become dissatisfied with system response time; (3) determine a threshold at which dissatisfaction may lead to discontinued use of the application, and (4) determine if experience influences response time tolerance. The results showed that indeed satisfaction does decrease as response time increases. However, instant response was not perceived as making the system easier to use or learn. It also showed that for discretionary applications, there appears to be a level of intolerance in the 12-second response range.},

abstract = {Most algorithms for mining or indexing time series data do not operate directly on the original data, but instead they consider alternative representations that include transforms, quantization, approximation, and multi-resolution abstractions. Choosing the best representation and abstraction level for a given task/dataset is arguably the most critical step in time series data mining. In this paper, we investigate techniques to discover the natural intrinsic representation model, dimensionality and alphabet cardinality of a time series. The ability to discover these intrinsic features has implications beyond selecting the best parameters for particular algorithms, as characterizing data in such a manner is useful in its own right and an important sub-routine in algorithms for classification, clustering and outlier discovery. We will frame the discovery of these intrinsic features in the Minimal Description Length (MDL) framework. Extensive empirical tests show that our method is simpler, more general and significantly more accurate than previous methods, and has the important advantage of being essentially parameter-free.},

The data points in each partition are transformed into a single dimensional value based on their similarity with respect to the reference point. This allows the points to be indexed using a B+-tree structure and KNN search to be performed using one-dimensional range search. The choice of partition and reference points adapts the index structure to the data distribution. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the iDistance technique, and report results demonstrating its effectiveness. We also present a cost model for iDistance KNN search, which can be exploited in query optimization.},

In this paper, we advocate interval skyline queries, a novel type of time series analysis queries. For a set of time series and a given time interval [i : j], an interval skyline query returns the time series which are not dominated by any other time series in the interval. We illustrate the usefulness of interval skyline queries in applications. Moreover, we develop an on-the-fly method and a view-materialization method to online answer interval skyline queries on time series. The on-the-fly method keeps the minimum and the maximum values of the time series using radix priority search trees and sketches, and computes the skyline at the query time. The view-materialization method maintains the skylines over all intervals in a compact data structure. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we show that both methods only require linear space and are efficient in query answering as well as incremental maintenance.},

However, existing research has been focused on classification and summarization of opinions using natural language processing and data mining techniques. An important issue that has been neglected so far is opinion spam or trustworthiness of online opinions. In this paper, we study this issue in the context of product reviews, which are opinion rich and are widely used by consumers and product manufacturers. In the past two years, several startup companies also appeared which aggregate opinions from product reviews. It is thus high time to study spam in reviews. To the best of our knowledge, there is still no published study on this topic, although Web spam and email spam have been investigated extensively. We will see that opinion spam is quite different from Web spam and email spam, and thus requires different detection techniques. Based on the analysis of 5.8 million reviews and 2.14 million reviewers from amazon.com, we show that opinion spam in reviews is widespread. This paper analyzes such spam activities and presents some novel techniques to detect them},

abstract = {The problem of efficiently finding patterns in massive time series databases has attracted great interest, and, at least for the Euclidean distance measure, may now be regarded as a solved problem. However in recent years there has been an increasing awareness that Euclidean distance is inappropriate for many real world applications. The limitations of Euclidean distance stems from the fact that it is very sensitive to distortions in the time axis. A partial solution to this problem, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), aligns the time axis before calculating the Euclidean distance. However, DTW can only address the problem of local scaling. As we demonstrate in this work, uniform scaling may be just as important in many domains, including applications as diverse as bioinformatics, space telemetry monitoring and motion editing for computer animation. In this work, we demonstrate a novel technique to speed up similarity search under uniform scaling. As we will demonstrate, our technique is simple and intuitive, and can achieve a speedup of 2 to 3 orders of magnitude under realistic settings.},

While recent work has focused primarily on manually identifiable instances of opinion spam, in this work we study deceptive opinion spam---fictitious opinions that have been deliberately written to sound authentic. Integrating work from psychology and computational linguistics, we develop and compare three approaches to detecting deceptive opinion spam, and ultimately develop a classifier that is nearly 90\% accurate on our gold-standard opinion spam dataset. Based on feature analysis of our learned models, we additionally make several theoretical contributions, including revealing a relationship between deceptive opinions and imaginative writing.},

abstract = {The matching of two-dimensional shapes is an important problem with applications in domains as diverse as biometrics, industry, medicine and anthropology. The distance measure used must be invariant to many distortions, including scale, offset, noise, partial occlusion, etc. Most of these distortions are relatively easy to handle, either in the representation of the data or in the similarity measure used. However rotation invariance seems to be uniquely difficult. Current approaches typically try to achieve rotation invariance in the representation of the data, at the expense of discrimination ability, or in the distance measure, at the expense of efficiency. In this work we show that we can take the slow but accurate approaches and dramatically speed them up. On real world problems our technique can take current approaches and make them four orders of magnitude faster, without false dismissals. Moreover, our technique can be used with any of the dozens of existing shape representations and with all the most popular distance measures including Euclidean distance, Dynamic Time Warping and Longest Common Subsequence.},

abstract = {The problem of similarity search in large time series databases has attracted much attention recently. It is a non-trivial problem because of the inherent high dimensionality of the data. The most promising solutions involve first performing dimensionality reduction on the data, and then indexing the reduced data with a spatial access method. Three major dimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and more recently the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). In this work we introduce a new dimensionality reduction technique which we call Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA). We theoretically and empirically compare it to the other techniques and demonstrate its superiority. In addition to being competitive with or faster than the other methods, our approach has numerous other advantages. It is simple to understand and to implement, it allows more flexible distance measures, including weighted Euclidean queries, and the index can be built in linear time.},

Time series discords are subsequences of a longer time series that are maximally different to all the rest of the time series subsequences. They thus capture the sense of the most unusual subsequence within a time series. Time series discords have many uses for data mining, including improving the quality of clustering, data cleaning, summarization, and anomaly detection. Discords are particularly attractive as anomaly detectors because they only require one intuitive parameter (the length of the subsequence) unlike most anomaly detection algorithms that typically require many parameters. We evaluate our work with a comprehensive set of experiments. In particular, we demonstrate the utility of discords with objective experiments on domains as diverse as Space Shuttle telemetry monitoring, medicine, surveillance, and industry, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our discord discovery algorithm with more than one million experiments, on 82 different datasets from diverse domains.},

abstract = {The problem of indexing time series has attracted much interest. Most algorithms used to index time series utilize the Euclidean distance or some variation thereof. However, it has been forcefully shown that the Euclidean distance is a very brittle distance measure. Dy- namic time warping (DTW) is a much more robust distance measure for time series, allowing similar shapes to match even if they are out of phase in the time axis. Because of this flexi- bility, DTW is widely used in science, medicine, industry and finance. Unfortunately, however, DTW does not obey the triangular inequality and thus has resisted attempts at exact indexing. Instead, many researchers have introduced approximate indexing techniques or abandoned the idea of indexing and concentrated on speeding up sequential searches. In this work, we intro- duce a novel technique for the exact indexing of DTW. We prove that our method guarantees no false dismissals and we demonstrate its vast superiority over all competing approaches in the largest and most comprehensive set of time series indexing experiments ever undertaken.},

abstract = {Breaking news, viral videos, and popular memes are all examples of the collective attention of huge numbers of users focusing in large-scale social systems. But this self-organization, leading to user attention quickly coalescing and then collectively focusing around a phenomenon, opens these systems to new threats like collective attention spam. Compared to many traditional spam threats, collective attention spam relies on the insidious property that users themselves will intentionally seek out the content where the spam will be encountered, potentially magnifying its effectiveness. Our goal in this paper is to initiate a study of this phenomenon. How susceptible are social systems to collective attention threats? What strategies by malicious users are most effective? Can a system automatically inoculate itself from emerging threats? Towards beginning our study of these questions, we take a two fold approach. First, we develop data-driven models to simulate large-scale social systems based on parameters derived from a real system. In this way, we can vary parameters — like the fraction of malicious users in the system, their strategies, and the countermeasures available to system operators — to explore the resilience of these systems to threats to collective attention. Second, we pair the data-driven model with a comprehensive evaluation over a Twitter system trace, in which we evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures deployed based on the first moments of a bursting phenomenon in a real system. Our experimental study shows the promise of these countermeasures to identifying threats to collective attention early in the lifecycle, providing a shield for unsuspecting social media users.},

Parameterized probability distributions that have sub- and supergaussian regimes were used to derive a general learning rule that preserves the simple architecture proposed by Bell and Sejnowski (1995), is optimized using the natural gradient by Amari (1998), and uses the stability analysis of Cardoso and Laheld (1996) to switch between sub- and supergaussian regimes. We demonstrate that the extended infomax algorithm is able to separate 20 sources with a variety of source distributions easily. Applied to high-dimensional data from electroencephalographic recordings, it is effective at separating artifacts such as eye blinks and line noise from weaker electrical signals that arise from sources in the brain.},

abstract = {The problem of finding time series discord has attracted much attention recently due to its numerous applications and several algorithms have been suggested. However, most of them suffer from high computation cost and cannot satisfy the requirement of real applications. In this paper, we propose a novel discord discovery algorithm BitClusterDiscord which is based on bit representation clustering. Firstly, we use PAA (Piecewise Aggregate Approximation) bit serialization to segment time series, so as to capture the main variation characteristic of time series and avoid the influence of noise. Secondly, we present an improved K-Medoids clustering algorithm to merge several patterns with similar variation behaviors into a common cluster. Finally, based on bit representation clustering, we design two pruning strategies and propose an effective algorithm for time series discord discovery. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed approach can not only effectively find discord of time series, but also greatly improve the computational efficiency. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Movement data have been widely collected from GPS and sensors, allowing us to analyze how moving objects interact in terms of space and time and to learn about the relationships that exist among the objects. In this paper, we investigate an interesting relationship that has not been adequately studied so far: the following relationship. Intuitively, a follower has similar trajectories as its leader but always arrives at a location with some time lag. The challenges in mining the following relationship are: (1) the following time lag is usually unknown and varying, (2) the trajectories of the follower and leader are not identical, and (3) the relationship is subtle and only occurs in a short period of time. In this paper, we propose a simple but practical method that addresses all these challenges. It requires only two intuitive parameters and is able to mine following time intervals between two trajectories in linear time. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

abstract = {With the advance of hardware and communication technologies, stream time series is gaining ever-increasing attention due to its importance in many applications such as financial data processing, network monitoring, Web click-stream analysis, sensor data mining, and anomaly detection. For all of these applications, an efficient and effective similarity search over stream data is essential. Because of the unique characteristics of the stream, for example, data are frequently updated and real-time response is required, the previous approaches proposed for searching through archived data may not work in the stream scenarios. Especially, in the cases where data often arrive periodically for various reasons (for example, the communication congestion or batch processing), queries on such incomplete time series or even future time series may result in inaccuracy using traditional approaches. Therefore, in this paper, we propose three approaches,<i> polynomial, Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), and probabilistic</i>, to predict the unknown values that have not arrived at the system and answer similarity queries based on the predicted data. We also apply efficient indexes, that is, a multidimensional hash index and a B<sup>+</sup>-tree, to facilitate the prediction and similarity search on future time series, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods for prediction and answering queries.},

abstract = {Similarity-based time-series retrieval has been a subject of long-term study due to its wide usage in many applications, such as financial data analysis, weather data forecasting, and multimedia data retrieval. Its original task was to find those time series similar to a pattern (query) time-series data, where both the pattern and data time series are static. Recently, with an increasing demand on stream data management, similarity-based stream time-series retrieval has raised new research issues due to its unique requirements during the stream processing, such as one-pass search and fast response. In this paper, we address the problem of matching both static and dynamic patterns over stream time-series data. We will develop a novel multiscale representation, called multiscale segment mean, for stream time-series data, which can be incrementally computed and thus perfectly adapted to the stream characteristics. Most importantly, we propose a novel multistep filtering mechanism, step by step, over the multiscale representation. Analysis indicates that the mechanism can greatly prune the search space and thus offer fast response. Furthermore, batch processing optimization and the dynamic case where patterns are also from stream time series are discussed. Extensive experiments show the multiscale representation together with the multistep filtering scheme can efficiently filter out false candidates and detect patterns, compared to the multiscale wavelet.},

abstract = {This paper aims to detect users generating spam reviews or review spammers. We identify several characteristic be- haviors of review spammers and model these behaviors so as to detect the spammers. In particular, we seek to model the following behaviors. First, spammers may target specific products or product groups in order to maximize their im- pact. Second, they tend to deviate from the other reviewers in their ratings of products. We propose scoring methods to measure the degree of spam for each reviewer and apply them on an Amazon review dataset. We then select a sub- set of highly suspicious reviewers for further scrutiny by our user evaluators with the help of a web based spammer eval- uation software specially developed for user evaluation ex- periments. Our results show that our proposed ranking and supervised methods are effective in discovering spammers and outperform other baseline method based on helpfulness votes alone. We finally show that the detected spammers have more significant impact on ratings compared with the unhelpful reviewers.},

abstract = {The problem of efficiently locating previously known patterns in a time series database (i.e., query by content) has received much attention and may now largely be regarded as a solved problem. However, from a knowledge discovery viewpoint, a more interesting problem is the enumeration of previously unknown, frequently occurring patterns. We call such patterns motifs, because of their close analogy to their discrete counterparts in computation biology. An efficient motif discovery algorithm for time series would be useful as a tool for summarizing and visualizing massive time series databases. In addition, it could be used as a subroutine in various other data mining tasks, including the discovery of association rules, clustering and classification. In this work we carefully motivate, then introduce, a non-trivial definition of time series motifs. We propose an efficient algorithm to discover them, and we demonstrate the utility and efficiency of our approach on several real world datasets.},

abstract = {The problem of time series classification (TSC), where we consider any real-valued ordered data a time series, presents a specific machine learning challenge as the ordering of variables is often crucial in finding the best discriminating features. One of the most promising recent approaches is to find shapelets within a data set. A shapelet is a time series subsequence that is identified as being representative of class membership. The original research in this field embedded the procedure of finding shapelets within a decision tree. We propose disconnecting the process of finding shapelets from the classification algorithm by proposing a shapelet transformation. We describe a means of extracting the best shapelets from a data set in a single pass, and then use these shapelets to transform data by calculating the distances from a series to each shapelet. We demonstrate that transformation into this new data space can improve classification accuracy, whilst retaining the explanatory power provided by shapelets.},

Most of these algorithms rely on pre-building an index (such as a trie) for subsequences. Users of these algorithms are typically required to choose optimal values for word-length and/or alphabet-size parameters of the index, which are not intuitive. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to directly search for the top-K discords, without the requirement of building an index or tuning external parameters. The algorithm exploits quasi-periodicity present in many time series. For quasi-periodic time series, the algorithm gains significant speedup by reducing the number of calls to the distance function. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {A home-based intelligent energy conservation system needs to know what appliances (or loads) are being used in the home and when they are being used in order to provide intelligent feedback or to make intelligent decisions. This analysis task is known as load disaggregation or non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). The datasets used for NILM research generally contain real power readings, with the data often being too coarse for more sophisticated analysis algorithms, and often covering too short a time period. We present the Almanac of Minutely Power dataset (AMPds) for load disaggregation research; it contains one year of data that includes 11 measurements at one minute intervals for 21 sub-meters. AMPds also includes natural gas and water consumption data. Finally, we use AMPds to present findings from our own load disaggregation algorithm to show that current, rather than real power, is a more effective measure for NILM.},

abstract = {Major severe weather events can cause a significant loss of life and property. We seek to revolutionize our understanding of and ability to predict such events through the mining of severe weather data. Because weather is inherently a spatiotemporal phenomenon, mining such data requires a model capable of representing and reasoning about complex spatiotemporal dynamics, including temporally and spatially varying attributes and relationships. We introduce an augmented version of the Spatiotemporal Relational Random Forest, which is a Random Forest that learns with spatiotemporally varying relational data. Our algorithm maintains the strength and performance of Random Forests but extends their applicability, including the estimation of variable importance, to complex spatiotemporal relational domains. We apply the augmented Spatiotemporal Relational Random Forest to three severe weather data sets. These are: predicting atmospheric turbulence across the continental United States, examining the formation of tornadoes near strong frontal boundaries, and understanding the translation of drought across the southern plains of the United States. The results on such a wide variety of real-world domains demonstrate the extensive applicability of the Spatiotemporal Relational Random Forest. Our long-term goal is to significantly improve the ability to predict and warn about severe weather events.},

abstract = {We introduce an efficient approach to mining multi-dimensional temporal streams of real-world data for ordered temporal motifs that can be used for prediction. Since many of the dimensions of the data are known or suspected to be irrelevant, our approach first identifies the salient dimensions of the data, then the key temporal motifs within each dimension, and finally the temporal ordering of the motifs necessary for prediction. For the prediction element, the data are assumed to be labeled. We tested the approach on two real-world data sets. To verify the generality of the approach, we validated the application on several subjects from the CMU Motion Capture database. Our main application uses several hundred numerically simulated supercell thunderstorms where the goal is to identify the most important features and feature interrelationships which herald the development of strong rotation in the lowest altitudes of a storm. We identified sets of precursors, in the form of meteorological quantities reaching extreme values in a particular temporal sequence, unique to storms producing strong low-altitude rotation. The eventual goal is to use this knowledge for future severe weather detection and prediction algorithms.},

The question remains as to how this selection of relevant items to be remembered is accomplished. Here we show that activity in the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia preceded the filtering of irrelevant information and that activity, particularly in the globus pallidus, predicted the extent to which only relevant information is stored. The preceding frontal and basal ganglia activity were also associated with inter-individual differences in working memory capacity. These findings reveal a mechanism by which frontal and basal ganglia activity exerts attentional control over access to working memory storage in the parietal cortex in humans, and makes an important contribution to inter-individual differences in working memory capacity.},

abstract = {Mining frequently occurring temporal motion patterns (motion motifs) is important for understanding, organizing and retrieving motion data. However, without any a priori knowledge of the motifs, such as their lengths, contents, locations and total number, it remains a challenging problem due to the enormous computational cost involved in analyzing huge motion databases. Moreover, since the same motion motif can exhibit different temporal and spatial variations, it prevents directly applying existing data mining methods to motion data. In this paper, we propose an efficient motif discovery method which can handle both spatial and temporal variations of motion data. We translate the motif discovery problem into finding continuous paths in a matching trellis, where each continuous path corresponds to an instance of a motif. A tree-growing method is introduced to search for the continuous paths constrained by a branching factor, and to accommodate intra-pattern variations of motifs. By using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to find the approximate matches and build the trellis, the overall complexity of our algorithm is only sub-quadratic to the size of the database, and is of linear memory cost. Experimental results on a data set of 32,260 frames show that our method can effectively discover meaningful motion motifs regardless of their spatial and temporal variations},

abstract = {Discovering recurring patterns in time series data is a fundamental problem for temporal data mining. This paper addresses the problem of locating subdimensional motifs in real-valued, multivariate time series, which requires the simultaneous discovery of sets of recurring patterns along with the corresponding relevant dimensions. While many approaches to motif discovery have been developed, most are restricted to categorical data, univariate time series, or multivariate data in which the temporal patterns span all of the dimensions. In this paper, we present an expected linear-time algorithm that addresses a generalization of multivariate pattern discovery in which each motif may span only a subset of the dimensions. To validate our algorithm, we discuss its theoretical properties and empirically evaluate it using several data sets including synthetic data and motion capture data collected by an on-body iner- tial sensor.},

abstract = {Time series motifs are repeated segments in a long time series that, if exist, carry precise information about the underlying source of the time series. Motif discovery in time series data has received significant attention in the data mining community since its inception, principally because, motif discovery is meaningful and more likely to succeed when the data is large. Algorithms for motif discovery generally deal with three aspects  the definition of the motifs, domain based preprocessing, and finally, the algorithmic steps. Typical definitions of motifs signify the similarity or the support of the motifs. Domains impose preprocessing requirements to meaningful motif finding such as data alignment, interpolation, and transformation. Motif discovery algorithms vary based on exact or approximate evaluation of the definition. In addition, algorithms require different representations [Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), DFT etc.] and similarity measures [correlation, dynamic time warping (DTW) distance etc.] for time series segments. In this paper, we discuss these  three facets  in detail with examples taken from the literature. We briefly describe a set of applications of time series motif in various domains and elaborate on  a certain  application in entomology to analyze insect behavior.

abstract = {The detection of repeated subsequences, time series motifs, is a problem which has been shown to have great utility for several higher-level data mining algorithms, including classification, clustering, segmentation, forecasting, and rule discovery. In recent years there has been significant research effort spent on efficiently discovering these motifs in static offline databases. However, for many domains, the inherent streaming nature of time series demands online discovery and maintenance of time series motifs. In this paper, we develop the first online motif discovery algorithm which monitors and maintains motifs exactly in real time over the most recent history of a stream. Our algorithm has a worst-case update time which is linear to the window size and is extendible to maintain more complex pattern structures. In contrast, the current offline algorithms either need significant update time or require very costly pre-processing steps which online algorithms simply cannot afford. Our core ideas allow useful extensions of our algorithm to deal with arbitrary data rates and discovering multidimensional motifs. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithms with a variety of case studies in the domains of robotics, acoustic monitoring and online compression.},

abstract = {Time series motifs are sets of very similar subsequences of a long time series. They are of interest in their own right, and are also used as inputs in several higher-level data mining algorithms including classification, clustering, rule-discovery and summarization. In spite of extensive research in recent years, finding exact time series motifs in massive databases is an open problem. Previous efforts either found approximate motifs or considered relatively small datasets residing in main memory. In this work, we describe for the first time a disk-aware algorithm to find exact time series motifs in multi-gigabyte databases which contain on the order of tens of millions of time series. We have evaluated our algorithm on datasets from diverse areas including medicine, anthropology, computer networking and image processing and show that we can find interesting and meaningful motifs in datasets that are many orders of magnitude larger than anything considered before.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of computing all-pair correlations in a warehouse containing a large number (e.g., tens of thousands) of time-series (or, signals). The problem arises in automatic discovery of patterns and anomalies in data intensive applications such as data center management, environmental monitoring, and scientific experiments. However, with existing techniques, solving the problem for a large stream warehouse is extremely expensive, due to the problem's inherent quadratic I/O and CPU complexities. We propose novel algorithms, based on Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) and graph partitioning, to reduce the end-to-end response time of an all-pair correlation query. To minimize I/O cost, we partition a massive set of input signals into smaller batches such that caching the signals one batch at a time maximizes data reuse and minimizes disk I/O. To reduce CPU cost, we propose two approximation algorithms. Our first algorithm efficiently computes approximate correlation coefficients of similar signal pairs within a given error bound. The second algorithm efficiently identifies, without any false positives or negatives, all signal pairs with correlations above a given threshold. For many real applications, our approximate solutions are as useful as corresponding exact solutions, due to our strict error guarantees. However, compared to the state-of-the-art exact algorithms, our algorithms are up to 17x faster for several real datasets.},

abstract = {Opinionated social media such as product reviews are now widely used by individuals and organizations for their decision making. However, due to the reason of profit or fame, people try to game the system by opinion spamming (e.g., writing fake reviews) to promote or demote some target products. For reviews to reflect genuine user experiences and opinions, such spam reviews should be detected. Prior works on opinion spam focused on detecting fake reviews and individual fake reviewers. However, a fake reviewer group (a group of reviewers who work collaboratively to write fake reviews) is even more damaging as they can take total control of the sentiment on the target product due to its size. This paper studies spam detection in the collaborative setting, i.e., to discover fake reviewer groups. The proposed method first uses a frequent itemset mining method to find a set of candidate groups. It then uses several behavioral models derived from the collusion phenomenon among fake reviewers and relation models based on the relationships among groups, individual reviewers, and products they reviewed to detect fake reviewer groups. Additionally, we also built a labeled dataset of fake reviewer groups. Although labeling individual fake reviews and reviewers is very hard, to our surprise labeling fake reviewer groups is much easier. We also note that the proposed technique departs from the traditional supervised learning approach for spam detection because of the inherent nature of our problem which makes the classic supervised learning approach less effective. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms multiple strong baselines including the state-of-the-art supervised classification, regression, and learning to rank algorithms.},

abstract = {A fundamental goal of memory research is to specify the conditions that lead to the strengthening and weakening of neural representations. Several computational models of memory formation predict that learning effects should vary as a nonmonotonic function of the amount of excitation received by a neural representation. Specifically, moderate excitation should result in synaptic weakening, while strong excitation should result in synaptic strengthening. In vitro investigations of plasticity in rodents have provided support for this prediction at the level of single synapses. However, it remains unclear whether this principle scales beyond the synapse to cortical representations and manifests changes in behavior. To address this question, we used electroencephalogram pattern classification in human subjects to measure trial-by-trial fluctuations in stimulus processing, and we used a negative priming paradigm to measure learning effects. In keeping with the idea that moderate excitation leads to weakening, moderate levels of stimulus processing were associated with negative priming (slower subsequent responding to the stimulus), but higher and lower levels of stimulus processing were not associated with negative priming. These results suggest that the same principles that account for synaptic weakening in rodents can also account for diminished accessibility of perceptual representations in humans.},

abstract = {Consumers’ purchase decisions are increasingly influenced by user-generated online reviews. Accordingly, there has been growing concern about the potential for posting decep- tive opinion spam—fictitious reviews that have been deliberately written to sound authentic, to deceive the reader. But while this practice has received considerable public attention and concern, relatively little is known about the actual prevalence, or rate, of deception in online review com- munities, and less still about the factors that influence it. We propose a generativemodel of deception which, in con- junction with a deception classifier, we use to explore the prevalence of deception in six popular online review communities: Expedia, Hotels.com, Orbitz, Priceline, TripAdvisor, and Yelp. We additionally propose a theoretical model of online reviews based on economic signaling theory, in which consumer reviews diminish the inherent information asymmetry between consumers and producers, by acting as a signal to a product’s true, unknown quality. We find that deceptive opinion spam is a growing problem overall, but with different growth rates across communities. These rates, we argue, are driven by the different signaling costs associated with deception for each review community, e.g., posting requirements. When measures are taken to increase signaling cost, e.g., filtering reviews written by first-time reviewers, deception prevalence is effectively reduced.},

abstract = { The past decade has seen a wealth of research on time series representations, because the manipulation, storage, and indexing of large volumes of raw time series data is impractical. The vast majority of research has concentrated on representations that are calculated in batch mode and represent each value with approximately equal fidelity. However, the increasing deployment of mobile devices and real time sensors has brought home the need for representations that can be incrementally updated, and can approximate the data with fidelity proportional to its age. The latter property allows us to answer queries about the recent past with greater precision, since in many domains recent information is more useful than older information. We call such representations amnesic. While there has been previous work on amnesic representations, the class of amnesic functions possible was dictated by the representation itself. We introduce a novel representation of time series that can represent arbitrary, user-specified amnesic functions. For example, a meteorologist may decide that data that is twice as old can tolerate twice as much error, and thus, specify a linear amnesic function. In contrast, an econometrist might opt for an exponential amnesic function. We propose online algorithms for our representation, and discuss their properties. Finally, we perform an extensive empirical evaluation on 40 datasets, and show that our approach can efficiently maintain a high quality amnesic approximation.},

It can do this quickly, with no buffering of stream values and without comparing pairs of streams. Moreover, it is any-time, single pass, and it dynamically detects changes. The dis- covered trends can also be used to immedi- ately spot potential anomalies, to do efficient forecasting and, more generally, to dramati- cally simplify further data processing. Our experimental evaluation and case studies show that SPIRIT can incrementally capture cor- relations and discover trends, efficiently and effectively. 1},

abstract = {We introduce a method to discover optimal local patterns, which concisely describe the main trends in a time series. Our approach examines the time series at multiple time scales (i.e., window sizes) and efficiently discovers the key patterns in each. We also introduce a criterion to select the best window sizes, which most concisely capture the key oscillatory as well as aperiodic trends. Our key insight lies in learning an optimal orthonormal transform from the data itself, as opposed to using a predetermined basis or approximating function (such as piecewise constant, short-window Fourier or wavelets), which essentially restricts us to a particular family of trends. We go one step further, lifting even that limitation. Furthermore, our method lends itself to fast, incremental estimation in a streaming setting. Experimental evaluation shows that our method can capture meaningful patterns in a variety of settings. Our streaming approach requires order of magnitude less time and space, while still producing concise and informative patterns.},

However, from a knowledge discovery viewpoint, a more interesting problem is the enumeration of previously unknown, frequently occurring patterns. We call such patterns "motifs", because of their close analogy to their discrete counterparts in computation biology. An efficient motif discovery algorithm for time series would be useful as a tool for summarizing and visualizing massive time series databases. In addition it could be used as a subroutine in various other data mining tasks, including the discovery of association rules, clustering and classification. In this paper we carefully motivate, then introduce, a nontrivial definition of time series motifs. We propose an efficient algorithm to discover them, and we demonstrate the utility and efficiency of our approach on several real world datasets.},

I listened monthly to dusk call displays of 17 Eagle Owl Bubo bubo males from early October to mid-February. Two different call periods exist in this species: in the first (October-December), the territorial function seems to be predominant, whereas in the second (January-February), calling related to mating prevails. Actually, in this latter period the behaviour of both male and female changes: both mate duets and number of copulations after them increase, and the choice of song posts and male vocal behaviour are different. The call functions are discussed in terms of the male-announcement, female-reproduction and territoryestablishment hypotheses.},

In this tutorial overview we review some of the key choices faced in using this approach as well as how to derive statistically significant results, illustrating each point from a case study. Furthermore, we show how, in addition to answering the question of 'is there information about a variable of interest' (pattern discrimination), classifiers can be used to tackle other classes of question, namely 'where is the information' (pattern localization) and 'how is that information encoded' (pattern characterization).},

The difficulty of scaling search to large datasets largely explains why most academic work on time series data mining has plateaued at considering a few millions of time series objects, while much of industry and science sits on billions of time series objects waiting to be explored. In this work we show that by using a combination of four novel ideas we can search and mine truly massive time series for the first time. We demonstrate the following extremely unintuitive fact; in large datasets we can exactly search under DTW much more quickly than the current state-of-the-art Euclidean distance search algorithms. We demonstrate our work on the largest set of time series experiments ever attempted. In particular, the largest dataset we consider is larger than the combined size of all of the time series datasets considered in all data mining papers ever published. We show that our ideas allow us to solve higher-level time series data mining problem such as motif discovery and clustering at scales that would otherwise be untenable. In addition to mining massive datasets, we will show that our ideas also have implications for real-time monitoring of data streams, allowing us to handle much faster arrival rates and/or use cheaper and lower powered devices than are currently possible.},

Shapelets not only provide interpretable results, which are useful for domain experts and developers alike, but shapelet-based classifiers have been shown by several independent research groups to have superior accuracy on many datasets. Moreover, shapelets can be seen as generalizing the lazy nearest neighbor classifier to an eager classifier. Thus, as a deployed classification tool, shapelets can be many orders of magnitude faster than any rival with comparable accuracy. Although shapelets are a useful concept, the current literature bemoans the fact that shapelet discovery is a time-consuming task. In spite of several efforts to speed up shapelet discovery algorithms, including the use of specialist hardware, the current state-of-the-art algorithms are still intractable on large datasets. In this work, we propose a fast shapelet discovery algorithm that outperforms the current state-of-the-art by two or three orders of magnitude, while producing models with accuracy that is not perceptibly different.},

abstract = {Given the pervasiveness of time series data in all human endeavors, and the ubiquity of clustering as a data mining application, it is somewhat surprising that the problem of time series clustering from a single stream remains largely unsolved. Most work on time series clustering considers the clustering of individual time series, e.g., gene expression profiles, individual heartbeats or individual gait cycles. The few attempts at clustering time series streams have been shown to be objectively incorrect in some cases, and in other cases shown to work only on the most contrived datasets by carefully adjusting a large set of parameters. In this work, we make two fundamental contributions. First, we show that the problem definition for time series clustering from streams currently used is inherently flawed, and a new definition is necessary. Second, we show that the Minimum Description Length (MDL) framework offers an efficient, effective and essentially parameter-free method for time series clustering. We show that our method produces objectively correct results on a wide variety of datasets from medicine, zoology and industrial process analyses.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that the time course for recognizing vocal expressions of basic emotion in speech varies significantly by emotion type, implying that listeners uncover acoustic evidence about emotions at different rates in speech (e.g., fear is recognized most quickly whereas happiness and disgust are recognized relatively slowly; Pell and Kotz, 2011). To investigate whether vocal emotion recognition is largely dictated by the amount of time listeners are exposed to speech or the position of critical emotional cues in the utterance, 40 English participants judged the meaning of emotionally-inflected pseudo-utterances presented in a gating paradigm, where utterances were gated as a function of their syllable structure in segments of increasing duration from the end of the utterance (i.e., gated syllable-by-syllable from the offset rather than the onset of the stimulus). Accuracy for detecting six target emotions in each gate condition and the mean identification point for each emotion in milliseconds were analyzed and compared to results from Pell and Kotz (2011). We again found significant emotion-specific differences in the time needed to accurately recognize emotions from speech prosody, and new evidence that utterance-final syllables tended to facilitate listeners' accuracy in many conditions when compared to utterance-initial syllables. The time needed to recognize fear, anger, sadness, and neutral from speech cues was not influenced by how utterances were gated, although happiness and disgust were recognized significantly faster when listeners heard the end of utterances first. Our data provide new clues about the relative time course for recognizing vocally-expressed emotions within the 400-1200 ms time window, while highlighting that emotion recognition from prosody can be shaped by the temporal properties of speech.},

@article{Ritter2013,
abstract = {Brain function is thought to emerge from the interactions among neuronal populations. Apart from traditional efforts to reproduce brain dynamics from the micro- to macroscopic scales, complementary approaches develop phenomenological models of lower complexity. Such macroscopic models typically generate only a few selected-ideally functionally relevant-aspects of the brain dynamics. Importantly, they often allow an understanding of the underlying mechanisms beyond computational reproduction. Adding detail to these models will widen their ability to reproduce a broader range of dynamic features of the brain. For instance, such models allow for the exploration of consequences of focal and distributed pathological changes in the system, enabling us to identify and develop approaches to counteract those unfavorable processes. Toward this end, The Virtual Brain (TVB) ( www.thevirtualbrain.org ), a neuroinformatics platform with a brain simulator that incorporates a range of neuronal models and dynamics at its core, has been developed. This integrated framework allows the model-based simulation, analysis, and inference of neurophysiological mechanisms over several brain scales that underlie the generation of macroscopic neuroimaging signals. In this article, we describe how TVB works, and we present the first proof of concept.},

Traditional dis- tance measures such as Euclidean distance or dynamic time warping are not always effective for analyzing uncertain time series data. Recently, some measures have been proposed to account for uncertainty in time series data. However, we show in this paper that their applicability is limited. In spe- cific, these approaches do not provide an intuitive way to compare two uncertain time series and do not easily accom- modate multiple error functions. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that generalizes the notion of similarity between uncertain time series. Secondly, we propose DUST, a novel distance mea- sure that accommodates uncertainty and degenerates to the Euclidean distance when the distance is large compared to the error. We provide an extensive experimental validation of our approach for the following applications: classification, top-k motif search, and top-k nearest-neighbor queries.},

Dozens of similarity/distance measures have been proposed in the last decade and there is increasing evidence that Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is the best measure across a wide range of domains. Given DTW\&\#x02019;s usefulness and ubiquity, there has been a large community-wide effort to mitigate its relative lethargy. Proposed speedup techniques include early abandoning strategies, lower-bound based pruning, indexing and embedding. In this work we argue that we are now close to exhausting all possible speedup from software, and that we must turn to hardware-based solutions. With this motivation, we investigate both GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) and FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) based acceleration of subsequence similarity search under the DTW measure. As we shall show, our novel algorithms allow GPUs to achieve two orders of magnitude speedup and FPGAs to produce four orders of magnitude speedup. We conduct detailed case studies on the classification of astronomical observations and demonstrate that our ideas allow us to tackle problems that would be untenable otherwise.},

For native listeners, it has been shown that word recognition is more difficult for strongly-accented words than for less strongly-accented words. Furthermore recognition of strongly-accented words becomes easier with additional exposure to the foreign accent. In this paper, listeners’ behaviour was simulated with Fine-tracker, a computational model of word recognition that uses real speech as input. The simulations showed that, in line with human listeners, 1) Fine-Tracker’s recognition outcome is modulated by the degree of accentedness and 2) it improves slightly after brief exposure with the accent. On the level of individual words, however, Fine-tracker failed to correctly simulate listeners’ behaviour, possibly due to differences in overall familiarity with the chosen accent (German-accented Dutch) between human listeners and Fine-Tracker.},

For example, with a database of one-hundred million time series, the approximate search can retrieve high quality nearest neighbors in slightly over a second, whereas a sequential scanwould take tens of minutes.Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our representation allows index performance to scalewell with increasing dataset sizes. Additionally, we provide analysis concerning parameter sensitivity, approximate search effectiveness, and lower bound comparisons between time series representations in a bit constrained environment.

Often, the available time for classification is not known a priori and may change as a consequence of external circumstances. Many traditional algorithms are unable to provide satisfactory performance while supporting the highly variable response times that exemplify such applications. In such contexts, anytime algorithms, which are amenable to trading time for accuracy, have been found to be exceptionally useful and constitute an area of increasing research activity. Previous techniques for improving anytime classification have generally been concerned with optimizing the probability of correctly classifying individual objects. However, as we shall see, serially optimizing the probability of correctly classifying individual objects K times, generally gives inferior results to batch optimizing the probability of correctly classifying K objects. In this work, we show that this simple observation can be exploited to improve overall classification performance by using an anytime framework to allocate resources among a set of objects buffered from a fast arriving stream. Our ideas are independent of object arrival behavior, and, perhaps unintuitively, even in data streams with constant arrival rates our technique exhibits a marked improvement in performance. The utility of our approach is demonstrated with extensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of diverse datasets.},

@article{Stafford:09,
abstract = {Feeding behavior of beet leafhopper, Circulifer tenellus (Baker) (Homoptera: Cicadellidae), was studied with a DC electrical penetration graph. Nine different electrical penetration graph waveforms associated with feeding were identified and characterized. Waveforms were correlated with specific feeding behaviors using a number of techniques, including high magnification video recording, honeydew analysis, stylectomy, and histological processing. Waveforms were grouped into three phases based on feeding behavior: pathway phase (waveforms A, B1, B2, and C), non-phloem ingestion phase (waveform G), and phloem phase (waveforms D1, D2, D3, and D4). No ingestion was found to occur during waveforms A, B1, B2, and C. Waveform G was associated primarily with ingestion of xylem sap and occasionally with ingestion of mesophyll sap. Stylet tips were located in phloem during waveforms D1, D2, and D3, and waveforms D2 and D3 were correlated with ingestion of phloem sap. Waveform D4 probably also plays a role in phloem ingestion, because D4 is very brief and always occurs embedded in either waveform D2 or D3. In contrast to most other homopteran insects, rate of honeydew production (and hence rate of ingestion) was much lower on phloem than on xylem. More rapid rates of ingestion are expected on phloem, because its high turgor pressure drives sap into the feeding insect whereas the negative pressure of xylem sap is expected to cause a slow rate of ingestion. The very slow ingestion rate of beet leafhopper feeding on phloem suggests that it is not able to exploit the high turgor pressure of phloem to achieve the high rate of ingestion that is typical of phloem ingestion by other insects.},

abstract = {The cerebrovascular coupling under neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibition was investigated in alpha-chloralose anesthetized rats. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses to electrical stimulation of the forepaw were measured before and after an intraperitoneal bolus of 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), an in vivo inhibitor of the neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase. Neuronal activity was measured by recording somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) via intracranial electrodes. 7-Nitroindazole produced a significant attenuation of the activation-elicited CBF (P<10(-6)), CBV (P<10(-6)), and BOLD responses (P<10(-6)), without affecting the baseline perfusion level. The average DeltaCBF was nulled, while DeltaBOLD and DeltaCBV decreased to approximately 30\% of their respective amplitudes before 7-NI administration. The average SEP amplitude decreased (P<10(-5)) to approximately 60\% of its pretreatment value. These data describe a pharmacologically induced uncoupling between neuronal and hemodynamic responses to functional activation, and provide further support for the critical role of neuronally produced NO in the cerebrovascular coupling.},

It can especially prevent the “short text problem” in lyrics. Our accuracy reached an average of 78.19\% for classifying 3766 unique songs into 14 emotion categories, with a statistically significant improvement over the audio-only and lyrics-only monomodal \{MEC\} systems. We also show that the proposed \{AdaBoost\} with decision stumps method performs statistically better on multimodal \{MEC\} than the well-known \{SVM\} classifier, which only has an average accuracy of 72.08\%.},

abstract = {Online reviews have been popularly adopted in many appli- cations. Since they can either promote or harm the reputa- tion of a product or a service, buying and selling fake reviews becomes a profitable business and a big threat. In this paper, we introduce a very simple, but powerful review spamming technique that could fail the existing feature-based detection algorithms easily. It uses one truthful review as a template, and replaces its sentences with those from other reviews in a repository. Fake reviews generated by this mechanism are extremely hard to detect: Both the state-of-the-art com- putational approaches and human readers acquire an error rate of 35\%-48\%, just slightly better than a random guess. While it is challenging to detect such fake reviews, we have made solid progress in suppressing them. A novel defense method that leverages the difference of semantic flows be- tween synthetic and truthful reviews is developed, which is able to reduce the detection error rate to approximate- ly 22\%, a significant improvement over the performance of existing approaches. Nevertheless, it is still a challenging research task to further decrease the error rate. Synthetic},

This problem can be solved optimally using dynamic programming in O(n2k) time, where n is the length of the sequence. Given that sequences in practice are too long, a quadratic algorithm is not an adequately fast solution. Here, we present an alternative constant- factor approximation algorithm with running time O(n4/3 k5/3 ). We call this algorithm the D N S algorithm. We also consider the recursive application of the DNS algorithm, that results in a faster algorithm (O(n log log n) running time) with O(log n) approxima- tion factor, and study the accuracy/efficiency tradeoff. Extensive experimental results show that these algorithms outperform other widely-used heuristics. The same algorithms can speed up solu- tions for other variants of the basic segmentation problem while maintaining constant their approximation factors. Our techniques can also be used in a streaming setting, with sublinear memory re- quirements.},

We use our insights to develop a classifier to retroactively detect several million fraudulent accounts sold via this marketplace, 95\% of which we disable with Twitter’s help.

Each image is loosely labeled with one of the 75,062 non-abstract nouns in English, as listed in the Wordnet lexical database. Hence the image database gives a comprehensive coverage of all object categories and scenes. The semantic information from Wordnet can be used in conjunction with nearest-neighbor methods to perform object classification over a range of semantic levels minimizing the effects of labeling noise.

abstract = {Most data mining operations include an integral search component at their core. For example, the performance of similarity search or classification based on Nearest Neighbors is largely dependent on the underlying compression and distance estimation techniques. As data repositories grow larger, there is an explicit need not only for storing the data in a compressed form, but also for facilitating mining operations directly on the compressed data. Naturally, the quality or tightness of the estimated distances on the compressed objects directly affects the search performance. We motivate our work within the setting of search engine weblog repositories, where keyword demand trends over time are represented and stored as compressed timeseries data. Search and analysis over such sequence data has important applications for the search engines, including discovery of important news events, keyword recommendation and efficient keyword-to-advertisement mapping. We present new mechanisms for very fast search operations over the compressed time-series data, with specific focus on weblog data. An important contribution of this work is the derivation of optimally tight bounds on the Euclidean distance estimation between compressed sequences. Since our methodology is applicable to sequential data in general, the proposed technique is of independent interest. Additionally, our distance estimation strategy is not tied to a specific compression methodology, but can be applied on top of any orthonormal based compression technique (Fourier, Wavelet, PCA, etc). The experimental results indicate that the new optimal bounds lead to a significant improvement in the pruning power of search compared to previous state-of-the-art, in many cases eliminating more than 80 \% of the candidate search sequences. 1},

abstract = {We present several methods for mining knowledge from the query logs of the MSN search engine. Using the query logs, we build a time series for each query word or phrase (e.g., 'Thanksgiving' or 'Christmas gifts') where the elements of the time series are the number of times that a query is issued on a day. All of the methods we describe use sequences of this form and can be applied to time series data generally. Our primary goal is the discovery of semantically similar queries and we do so by identifying queries with similar demand patterns. Utilizing the best Fourier coefficients and the energy of the omitted components, we improve upon the state-of-the-art in time-series similarity matching. The extracted sequence features are then organized in an efficient metric tree index structure. We also demonstrate how to efficiently and accurately discover the important periods in a time-series. Finally we propose a simple but effective method for identification of bursts (long or short-term). Using the burst information extracted from a sequence, we are able to efficiently perform 'query-by-burst' on the database of time-series. We conclude the presentation with the description of a tool that uses the described methods, and serves as an interactive exploratory data discovery tool for the MSN query database.},

abstract = {Online reviews provide valuable information about products and services to consumers. However, spammers are joining the community trying to mislead readers by writing fake reviews. Previous attempts for spammer detection used reviewers' behaviors, text similarity, linguistics features and rating patterns. Those studies are able to identify certain types of spammers, e.g., those who post many similar reviews about one target entity. However, in reality, there are other kinds of spammers who can manipulate their behaviors to act just like genuine reviewers, and thus cannot be detected by the available techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of a heterogeneous review graph to capture the relationships among reviewers, reviews and stores that the reviewers have reviewed. We explore how interactions between nodes in this graph can reveal the cause of spam and propose an iterative model to identify suspicious reviewers. This is the first time such intricate relationships have been identified for review spam detection. We also develop an effective computation method to quantify the trustiness of reviewers, the honesty of reviews, and the reliability of stores. Different from existing approaches, we don't use review text information. Our model is thus complementary to existing approaches and able to find more difficult and subtle spamming activities, which are agreed upon by human judges after they evaluate our results.},

abstract = {The previous decade has brought a remarkable increase of the interest in applications that deal with querying and mining of time series data. Many of the research efforts in this context have focused on introducing new representation methods for dimensionality reduction or novel similarity measures for the underlying data. In the vast majority of cases, each individual work introducing a particular method has made specific claims and, aside from the occasional theoretical justifications, provided quantitative experimental observations. However, for the most part, the comparative aspects of these experiments were too narrowly focused on demonstrating the benefits of the proposed methods over some of the previously introduced ones. In order to provide a comprehensive validation, we conducted an extensive experimental study re-implementing eight different time series representations and nine similarity measures and their variants, and testing their effectiveness on thirty-eight time series data sets from a wide variety of application domains. In this paper, we give an overview of these different techniques and present our comparative experimental findings regarding their effectiveness. In addition to providing a unified validation of some of the existing achievements, our experiments also indicate that, in some cases, certain claims in the literature may be unduly optimistic.},

We focused on two Dutch diphthongs: ui and ij. Though both diphthongs deviated from standard Dutch to varying degrees and perceptually varied in accent strength, native Dutch listeners recognized words containing the diphthongs easily.

While some classifiers have been proposed to achieve good earliness in classification, the interpretability of early classification remains largely an open problem. Without interpretable features, application domain experts such as medical doctors may be reluctant to adopt early classification. In this paper, we tackle the problem of extracting interpretable features on time series for early classification. Specifically, we advocate local shapelets as features, which are segments of time series remaining in the same space of the input data and thus are highly interpretable. We extract local shapelets distinctly manifesting a target class locally and early so that they are effective for early classification. Our experimental results on seven benchmark real data sets clearly show that the local shapelets extracted by our methods are highly interpretable and can achieve effective early classification},

Their main domain of application is the field of bioinformatics where they are frequently used by researchers in order to elucidate genomic sequence similarities and alignment. However, this useful technique has remained comparatively constrained to domains where the data has an inherent discrete structure (i.e., text). In this paper we demonstrate how dot plots can be used for the analysis and mining of real-valued time series. We design a tool that creates highly descriptive dot plots which allow one to easily detect similarities, anomalies, reverse similarities, and periodicities well as changes in the frequencies of repetitions. As the underlying algorithm scales we with the input size, we also show the feasibility of the plots for on-line data monitoring},

In this work we show that most previous applications of time series motifs have been severely limited by the definition's brittleness to even slight changes of uniform scaling, the speed at which the patterns develop. We introduce a new algorithm that allows discovery of time series motifs with invariance to uniform scaling, and show that it produces objectively superior results in several important domains.

However, virtually all proposed methods assume that the data reside in main memory. For many real-world problems this is not be the case. For example, in astronomy, multi-terabyte time series datasets are the norm. Most current algorithms faced with data which cannot fit in main memory resort to multiple scans of the disk/tape and are thus intractable. In this work we show how one particular definition of unusual time series, the time series discord, can be discovered with a disk aware algorithm. The proposed algorithm is exact and requires only two linear scans of the disk with a tiny buffer of main memory. Furthermore, it is very simple to implement. We use the algorithm to provide further evidence of the effectiveness of the discord definition in areas as diverse as astronomy, Web query mining, video surveillance, etc., and show the efficiency of our method on datasets which are many orders of magnitude larger than anything else attempted in the literature.},

However, there are many applications which are characterized by two special conditions, firstly the two datasets to be joined are of radically different sizes, a situation we call an asymmetric join. Secondly, the two datasets are not, and possibly can not be indexed for some reason. In such circumstances the time complexity is proportional to the product of the number of objects in each of the two datasets, an untenable proposition in most cases. In this work we make two contributions to mitigate this situation. We argue that for many applications, an exact solution to the problem is not required, and we show that by framing the problem as an anytime algorithm we can extract most of the benefit of a join in a small fraction of the time taken by the full algorithm. In situations where the exact answer is required, we show that we can quickly index just the smaller dataset on the fly, and greatly speed up the exact computation. We motivate and empirically confirm the utility of our ideas with case studies on problems as diverse as batch classification, anomaly detection and annotation of historical manuscripts.

abstract = {Classification of time series has been attracting great interest over the past decade. Recent empirical evidence has strongly suggested that the simple nearest neighbor algorithm is very difficult to beat for most time series problems. While this may be considered good news, given the simplicity of implementing the nearest neighbor algorithm, there are some negative consequences of this. First, the nearest neighbor algorithm requires storing and searching the entire dataset, resulting in a time and space complexity that limits its applicability, especially on resource-limited sensors. Second, beyond mere classification accuracy, we often wish to gain some insight into the data. In this work we introduce a new time series primitive, time series shapelets, which addresses these limitations. Informally, shapelets are time series subsequences which are in some sense maximally representative of a class. As we shall show with extensive empirical evaluations in diverse domains, algorithms based on the time series shapelet primitives can be interpretable, more accurate and significantly faster than state-of-the-art classifiers.},

abstract = {In many applications, the data of interest comprises multiple
sequences that evolve over time. Examples include currency exchange
rates and network traffic data. We develop a fast method to analyze such
co-evolving time sequences jointly to allow (a) estimation/forecasting
of missing/delayed/future values, (b) quantitative data mining, and (c)
outlier detection. Our method, MUSCLES, adapts to changing correlations
among time sequences. It can handle indefinitely long sequences
efficiently using an incremental algorithm and requires only a small
amount of storage and less I/O operations. To make it scale for a large
number of sequences, we present a variation, the Selective MUSCLES
method and propose an efficient algorithm to reduce the problem size.
Experiments on real datasets show that MUSCLES outperforms popular
competitors in prediction accuracy up to 10 times, and discovers
interesting correlations. Moreover, Selective MUSCLES scales up very
well for large numbers of sequences, reducing response time up to 110
times over MUSCLES, and sometimes even improves the prediction quality

abstract = {Fast similarity searching in large time sequence databases has
typically used Euclidean distance as a dissimilarity metric. However,
for several applications, including matching of voice, audio and medical
signals (e.g., electrocardiograms), one is required to permit local
accelerations and decelerations in the rate of sequences, leading to a
popular, field tested dissimilarity metric called the \&amp;ldquo;time
warping\&amp;rdquo; distance. From the indexing viewpoint, this metric
presents two major challenges: (a) it does not lead to any natural
indexable \&amp;ldquo;features\&amp;rdquo;, and (b) comparing two sequences
requires time quadratic in the sequence length. To address each problem,
we propose to use: (a) a modification of the so called
\&amp;ldquo;FastMap\&amp;rdquo;, to map sequences into points, with little
compromise of \&amp;ldquo;recall\&amp;rdquo; (typically zero); and (b) a fast
linear test, to help us discard quickly many of the false alarms that
FastMap will typically introduce. Using both ideas in cascade, our

abstract = {In many advanced database applications (e.g., multimedia databases), data objects are transformed into high-dimensional points and manipulated in high-dimensional space. One of the most important but costly operations is the similarity join that combines similar points from multiple datasets. In this paper, we examine the problem of processing K-nearest neighbor similarity join (KNN join). KNN join between two datasets, R and S, returns for each point in R its K most similar points in S. We propose a new index-based KNN join approach using the iDistance as the underlying index structure. We first present its basic algorithm and then propose two different enhancements. In the first enhancement, we optimize the original KNN join algorithm by using approximation bounding cubes. In the second enhancement, we exploit the reduced dimensions of data space. We conducted an extensive experimental study using both synthetic and real datasets, and the results verify the performance advantage of our schemes over existing KNN join algorithms. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Time series clustering has become an increasingly important research topic over the past decade. Most existing methods for time series clustering rely on distances calculated from the entire raw data using the Euclidean distance or Dynamic Time Warping distance as the distance measure. However, the presence of significant noise, dropouts, or extraneous data can greatly limit the accuracy of clustering in this domain. Moreover, for most real world problems, we cannot expect objects from the same class to be equal in length. As a consequence, most work on time series clustering only considers the clustering of individual time series "behaviors," e.g., individual heart beats or individual gait cycles, and contrives the time series in some way to make them all equal in length. However, contriving the data in such a way is often a harder problem than the clustering itself. In this work, we show that by using only some local patterns and deliberately ignoring the rest of the data, we can mitigate the above problems and cluster time series of different lengths, i.e., cluster one heartbeat with multiple heartbeats. To achieve this we exploit and extend a recently introduced concept in time series data mining called shapelets. Unlike existing work, our work demonstrates for the first time the unintuitive fact that shapelets can be learned from unlabeled time series. We show, with extensive empirical evaluation in diverse domains, that our method is more accurate than existing methods. Moreover, in addition to accurate clustering results, we show that our work also has the potential to give insights into the domains to which it is applied.},

In multi-label learning, the training set is composed of instances each associated with a set of labels, and the task is to predict the label sets of unseen instances through analyzing training instances with known label sets. In this paper, a multi-label lazy learning approach named ML-KNN is presented, which is derived from the traditional K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. In detail, for each unseen instance, its K nearest neighbors in the training set are firstly identified. After that, based on statistical information gained from the label sets of these neighboring instances, i.e. the number of neighboring instances belonging to each possible class, maximum a posteriori (MAP) principle is utilized to determine the label set for the unseen instance. Experiments on three different real-world multi-label learning problems, i.e. Yeast gene functional analysis, natural scene classification and automatic web page categorization, show that ML-KNN achieves superior performance to some well-established multi-label learning algorithms. ?? 2007 Pattern Recognition Society.},

abstract = {Events occur in every aspect of our lives. An unexpectedly large number of events occurring within some certain measurement (e.g. within some time du- ration or a spatial region) is called a burst, suggesting unusual behaviors or ac- tivities. Bursts come up in many natural and social processes. It is a challenging task to monitor the occurrence of bursts whose lasting duration is unknown in a fast data stream environment. This work describes efficient data structures and algorithms for high per- formance burst detection under different settings. Our view is that bursts, as unusual phenomena, constitute a useful preliminary primitive in a knowledge discovery hierarchy. Our intent is to build a high performance primitive detec- tion algorithm to support high-level data mining tasks. The work starts with an algorithmic framework including a family of data structures and a heuristic optimization algorithm to choose an efficient data structure given the inputs. The advantage of this framework is that it is adaptive to different inputs. Experiments on both synthetic data and real world data show the new framework significantly outperforms existing techniques over a variety of inputs. Furthermore, we present a greedy dynamic detection algorithm which han- dles the changing data. It evolves the structure to adapt to the incoming data. It achieves better performance on both synthetic and real data streams than a static algorithm in most cases. We have applied this framework to several real world applications in physics, stock trading and website traffic monitoring. All the case studies show that our framework has real time response. We extend this framework to multi-dimensional data and use it in an epi- demiology simulation to detect infectious disease outbreak and spread.},

abstract = {Consider the problem of monitoring tens of thousands of time series data streams in an online fashion and making decisions based on them. In addition to single stream statistics such as average and standard deviation, we also want to find high correlations among all pairs of streams. A stock market trader might use such a tool to spot arbitrage opportunities. This paper proposes efficient methods for solving this problem based on Discrete Fourier Transforms and a three level time interval hierarchy. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real world financial trading data show that our algorithm beats the direct computation approach by several orders of magnitude. It also improves on previous Fourier Transform approaches by allowing the efficient computation of time-delayed correlation over any size sliding window and any time delay. Correlation also lends itself to an efficient grid-based data structure. The result is the first algorithm that we know of to compute correlations over thousands of data streams in real time. The algorithm is incremental, has fixed response time, and can monitor the pair-wise correlations of 10,000 streams on a single PC. The algorithm is embarrassingly parallelizable.},

abstract = {Anytime algorithms give intelligent systems the capability to trade deliberation time for quality of results. This capability is essential for successful operation in domains such as signal interpretation, real-time diagnosis and repair, and mobile robot control. What characterizes these domains is that it is not feasible (computationally) or desirable (economically) to compute the optimal answer. This article surveys the main control problems that arise when a system is composed of several anytime algorithms. These problems relate to optimal management of uncertainty and precision. After a brief introduction to anytime computation, I outline a wide range of existing solutions to the metalevel control problem and describe current work that is aimed at increasing the applicability of anytime computation.},

abstract = {In this study, the individually determined upper alpha frequency band in EEG (electroencephalogram) was investigated as a neurofeedback parameter. Fourteen subjects were trained on five sessions within 1. week by means of feedback dependent on the current upper alpha amplitude. On the first and fifth session, cognitive ability was tested by a mental rotation test. As a result, eleven of the fourteen subjects showed significant training success. Individually determined upper alpha was increased independently of other frequency bands. The enhancement of cognitive performance was significantly larger for the neurofeedback group than for a control group who did not receive feedback. Thus, enhanced cognitive control went along with an increased upper alpha amplitude that was found in the neurofeedback group only. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

The proposed project focuses on algorithmic development and mostly, uses public datasets. We have taken and will take permission from data donors before we make any attempt to redistribute. The PI has a track record of having a webpage set up for each of his publications \cite{page} where all the code, slide, data, excel sheets and user comments are maintained for perpetuity. PI will continue the same for this project.


\textit{Reproducibility statement:} We are committed to have all of our experiments reproducible. Anything that we publish, we make the experimental results, commands with parameters and the data public \cite{page}. We make arrangements for anonymous reviewing in conferences using cloud storage and support experiments in other platforms.

\textit{Sharing statement:} We share all of our code in raw and executable format. We will manage a wiki which will document the code. There will be video demonstration and presentation slides for the instructors. Dr. Mueen has a strong background in sharing code and providing support years after the projects are done and papers are published (see \cite{page}).
